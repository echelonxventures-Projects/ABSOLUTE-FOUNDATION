*This artifact defines the implementation architecture of the Constitutional Completeness Engine (CCE). It is a **determination and architecture artifact only**: it contains no new engine, no new corpus, and no new authority. It specifies how CCE **orchestrates existing certified controls by reference** to produce one fail-closed completeness determination. Every mechanism it invokes already exists in the repository and was verified by direct source inspection; CCE modifies, forks, weakens, and re-certifies none of them (additive-only). Where any realization derived from this artifact would conflict with a higher instrument (the frozen constitutional corpus, the Technology Constitution, the Implementation Governance Baseline, ARCH-GOV-001, or the certified EC-1 engine), the higher instrument governs and the derived realization is void to the extent of the conflict.*

---

## AUTHORITY BOUNDARY (MANDATORY)

1. **Orchestration only.** CCE invokes the certified Coverage, Validation, and Certification engines through their **published, versioned surfaces**. It re-implements no check, criterion, verdict, gate, ledger rule, or evidence format (TP-01).
2. **Additive-only over the engines.** CCE **SHALL NOT** modify, fork, re-derive, or re-certify any `engine/*` or `platform/*` module, and **SHALL NOT** weaken any invariant (determinism, immutability, registry-only access, no frozen-corpus writes, fail-closed certification).
3. **Provisional-state disclosure (DE-05 / IP-01).** Every CCE determination asserts no constitutional finality and carries the EC-1 provisional-state disclosure (`ENGINEERING-EXECUTION-ONLY`) verbatim.
4. **Read-only corpus.** CCE writes nothing to `00-SOURCE/`, `99-FREEZE/`, `00-BOOK/` (DP-03).

---

## SECTION 1 — ARCHITECTURE

CCE is a thin **orchestration + aggregation + determination** layer over five existing certified control surfaces. It contains three logical components and no engine of its own.

```

**Component 1 — Subject Projector.** Normalizes a completeness target into the subjects the existing engines already accept — `ValidationSubject` (`engine/validation/contracts.py`, incl. `from_runtime_unit`), `CertificationSubject.from_validation` (`engine/certification/contracts.py`), and the Coverage evidence bundle (`platform/coverage/evidence.py`). It adds no judgment; it only re-shapes inputs (mirrors the existing façade projection discipline).

**Component 2 — Gate Orchestrator.** Evaluates the ten constitutional gates (Constitution §"Mandatory Completeness Gates") as **pure predicates** over the certified engines' outputs. It calls each engine once, read-only, through its published surface.

**Component 3 — Determination Recorder.** Aggregates the ten gate verdicts into a single fail-closed **Completeness Verdict**, records it as an immutable content-addressed **Completeness Determination Record**, and appends it to the existing `CertificationLedger` (`engine/certification/ledger.py`). The aggregation pattern reuses the A1–A10 acceptance-framework model in `engine/certification/closure.py::build_program_closure`.

---

## SECTION 2 — INTEGRATION POINTS

Every integration is **by reference** to a published surface. No engine internals are imported or copied.

| CCE need | Integration point (existing) | Call | Direction |
|----------|------------------------------|------|-----------|
| Coverage verdict + gaps/orphans | `platform/coverage/certification.py::assess(engine, strict=True)` | read | inbound → CCE |
| Coverage report detail | `platform/coverage/engine.py::CoverageEngine.report()/verify()` | read | inbound |
| Coverage health | `platform/coverage/health.py::CoverageHealth.probe(strict=True)` | read | inbound |
| Validation verdict | `platform/validation/facade.py::ValidationFacade.surface(subject)` | read | inbound |
| Validation acceptance | `engine/validation/gates.py::enforce_acceptance(report)` | read | inbound |
| Dependency closure | `engine/validation/checks.py::DependencyClosureCheck` (within suite) | read | inbound |
| Certification decision + record | `platform/certification/facade.py::CertificationFacade.surface(report, evidence, version=…)` | read | inbound |
| Readiness | `platform/certification/status.py::evaluate_readiness(decision)` | read | inbound |
| Governance / compliance | `platform/certification/status.py::validate_governance(decision)` | read | inbound |
| Audit / immutability | `engine/certification/ledger.py::CertificationLedger.append(record)` | append-only | CCE → ledger |
| Gap escalation | ARCH-GOV-001 LAW 003 (STOP → GAP REPORT → REQUEST AUTHORITY) | invoke | CCE → governance |

**Contract binding.** CCE binds the published contract references already present in `platform/foundation/contracts.py::ENGINE_CONTRACTS` (`engine.validation.validate`, `engine.certification.certify`) and the coverage contract surface `platform/coverage/contracts.py::COVERAGE_CONTRACTS` — versioned, by reference (AR-03/PL-05).

---

## SECTION 3 — REUSE MAPPING

| Capability | Existing Source | Reuse Decision | New Work Required |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Coverage Engine | `platform/coverage/` | **REUSE** | None |
| Validation Engine | `engine/validation/` + `platform/validation/facade.py` | **REUSE** | None |
| Certification Engine | `engine/certification/` + `platform/certification/facade.py` | **REUSE** | None |
| Dependency Closure | `engine/validation/checks.py::DependencyClosureCheck` | **REUSE** | None |
| Readiness | `platform/certification/status.py::evaluate_readiness` | **REUSE** | None |
| Governance / Compliance | `platform/certification/status.py::validate_governance` | **REUSE** | None |
| Audit (immutable ledger) | `engine/certification/ledger.py::CertificationLedger` | **REUSE** | None |
| Gap Detection | Coverage graph gaps/orphans + ARCH-GOV-001 LAW 003 | **REUSE** | None |
| Traceability | `provenance-chain` + Coverage edge `trace()` + GOV-002 | **REUSE** | None |
| Acceptance-framework aggregation | `engine/certification/closure.py::build_program_closure` | **REUSE (pattern)** | Aggregation over 10 gates instead of A1–A10 |
| Content-addressing / determinism | `engine/certification/contracts.py::content_hash` · `platform/foundation/contracts.py` | **REUSE** | None |
| **Unified completeness determination** | **(none exists)** | **NEW (orchestration only)** | Subject Projector + Gate Orchestrator + Determination Recorder |

**Net-new invention: none at the engine level.** The only new code (were CCE realized as code) is the ~3-component orchestration layer that binds existing surfaces.

---

## SECTION 4 — EXECUTION FLOW

Deterministic, fail-closed, single-pass. Any step that cannot resolve halts with a Gap Report (CCE-LAW-008).

```
1. INPUT        Receive completeness target (artifact | architecture | platform |
                service | application | runtime | universe | generation output |
                deliverable).

2. PROJECT      Subject Projector → ValidationSubject / CertificationSubject /
                Coverage evidence bundle.  (no judgment)

3. GATE 1  Architecture Complete   ← CoverageEngine.report()/verify()   (zero orphans)
   GATE 2  Dependencies Closed     ← DependencyClosureCheck             (single-rooted, pinned)
   GATE 3  Coverage Verified       ← coverage.assess(strict=True)       (deterministic, 0 violations)
   GATE 4  Validation Passed       ← ValidationFacade.surface → PASS + accepted
   GATE 5  Traceability Complete   ← provenance-chain + coverage edge trace()
   GATE 6  Evidence Complete       ← ValidationEvidence + CertificationEvidence present
   GATE 7  Certification Ready     ← CertificationFacade.surface → no blocking criterion
   GATE 8  Readiness Approved      ← evaluate_readiness → ready == True
   GATE 9  Gap Count = Zero        ← CoverageEngine.report()["gaps"] empty + all 24 dims resolved

4. AGGREGATE    Completeness Verdict = COMPLETE  iff  Gates 1..9 all CLOSED
                                     = NOT COMPLETE  otherwise  (fail-closed)

5. GATE 10 Completeness Certified  ← CertificationEngine.certify → CERTIFIED
                                     + CertificationLedger.append (hash chain intact)

6. RECORD       Emit immutable, content-addressed Completeness Determination Record
                (carries EC-1 provisional-state disclosure, ENGINEERING-EXECUTION-ONLY).

7. ESCALATE     If any gate OPEN → Gap Report (ARCH-GOV-001 LAW 003) → halt.
                No partial or speculative completeness is emitted.
```

The determination is a **pure function** of the aggregated engine outputs: identical inputs yield a byte-identical record and a stable determination id (IMP-007 §5; reuses `content_hash`).

---

## SECTION 5 — COVERAGE FLOW

1. CCE constructs a `CoverageEngine` over the target's evidence source (`platform/coverage/engine.py`).
2. CCE calls `assess(engine, strict=True)` (`platform/coverage/certification.py`) → `CoverageCertification`.
3. **Gate 3 CLOSED** iff `coverage_determinism_status == "deterministic"` and `coverage_violations == ()`.
4. **Gate 1 CLOSED** iff `report()["orphans"] == []` (no `ORPHANED` node).
5. **Gate 9 (coverage portion) CLOSED** iff `report()["gaps"] == []` (no `UNCOVERED`/`PARTIAL`).
6. CCE records the `CoverageCertification.certification_id` and fingerprint as gate evidence. It computes no coverage itself.

---

## SECTION 6 — VALIDATION FLOW

1. CCE builds a `ValidationSubject` for the target (`ValidationSubject.from_runtime_unit` for runtime targets, or the field constructor).
2. CCE calls `ValidationFacade.surface(subject)` (`platform/validation/facade.py`) → `SurfacedValidation` (report + evidence + acceptance decision), reproduced byte-for-byte from the certified engine.
3. **Gate 4 CLOSED** iff `report.verdict == PASS` and `decision.accepted == True` (no blocking failure).
4. **Gate 2 CLOSED** iff the `dependency-closure-pinned` finding passed.
5. **Gate 5 (validation portion) CLOSED** iff `provenance-chain` passed.
6. **Gate 6 (validation portion) CLOSED** iff `ValidationEvidence` is present and content-hashable.
7. CCE re-runs no check and redefines no verdict; it reads findings from the surfaced report.

---

## SECTION 7 — CERTIFICATION FLOW

1. CCE projects the surfaced `ValidationReport` + `ValidationEvidence` into a `CertificationSubject` via `CertificationSubject.from_validation(..., version=…)`.
2. CCE calls `CertificationFacade.surface(report, evidence, version=…)` (`platform/certification/facade.py`) → `SurfacedCertification` (decision + immutable record + evidence).
3. **Gate 7 CLOSED** iff no blocking certification criterion failed (`default_criteria`: validation-accepted, validation-evidence-present, provisional-state-disclosed, version-pinned).
4. **Gate 8 CLOSED** iff `evaluate_readiness(decision).ready == True` (five indicators, zero blockers).
5. Compliance is confirmed via `validate_governance(decision).compliant == True` (six governance rules).
6. **Gate 10 CLOSED** iff Gates 1–9 CLOSED **and** `decision.status == CERTIFIED` **and** `CertificationLedger.append(record)` succeeds with an intact hash chain.
7. The appended entry is the audit-grade, tamper-evident record of the completeness determination.

---

## SECTION 8 — DETERMINATION RECORD (OUTPUT SCHEMA)

The single output of CCE. Content-addressed, immutable, ledgered, reproducible.

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `completeness_id` | `content_hash` of the record core (stable id) |
| `target_id` / `target_kind` | input |
| `verdict` | `COMPLETE` \| `NOT COMPLETE` (fail-closed aggregate of Gates 1–10) |
| `gates` | ten `{gate_id, status, evidence_ref}` rows |
| `dimensions` | 24 `{dimension, source, satisfied}` rows |
| `coverage_certification_id` | `CoverageCertification.certification_id` |
| `validation_report_fingerprint` | `SurfacedValidation.report_fingerprint()` |
| `certification_id` | `CertificationRecord.certification_id` |
| `readiness_id` | `CertificationReadiness.readiness_id` |
| `gap_report` | non-empty **only** when `verdict == NOT COMPLETE` |
| `ledger_entry_hash` | `CertificationLedger` head after append |
| `authority` | `ENGINEERING-EXECUTION-ONLY` |
| `disclosure` | EC-1 provisional-state disclosure (verbatim) |
| `content_sha256` | self-verifying content hash |

---

## SECTION 9 — DEPENDENCY MAPPING

| CCE dependency | Artifact / module | Type | Coupling |
|----------------|-------------------|------|----------|
| Governing constitution | `02-MASTER/UCOS-COMP-000001-…-CONSTITUTION.md` | governance | subordinate |
| Completeness gate / gap law / traceability law | ARCH-GOV-001 | governance | consumes by reference |
| Coverage | `platform/coverage/*` | engine | read-only |
| Validation | `engine/validation/*`, `platform/validation/facade.py` | engine | read-only |
| Certification | `engine/certification/*`, `platform/certification/facade.py` | engine | read-only, append-only ledger |
| Readiness / Governance | `platform/certification/status.py` | derivation | read-only |
| Content-addressing / contracts | `platform/foundation/contracts.py`, `engine/certification/contracts.py` | foundation | read-only |
| Dimension authorities | ARCH-DATA/API/WORKFLOW/SERVICE/APPLICATION/SECURITY/INFRA/OBS/EVENT/AI-001 | governance | consumes by reference |

**Closure:** every CCE dependency resolves to a registered, existing artifact or module (verified by direct inspection). There are **no dangling or speculative dependencies**. Any future dependency that cannot be resolved triggers CCE-LAW-008.

---

## SECTION 10 — GAP ANALYSIS

| # | Determination | Finding (evidence) |
|---|---------------|--------------------|
| 1 | Existing completeness controls | Present: Coverage, Validation, Certification engines + ledger + readiness/governance derivations. |
| 2 | Existing completeness gaps | One structural gap: **no single authority unifies the controls across all targets/dimensions/gates**. Each engine answers its own slice only. |
| 3 | Existing overlap | Certification aggregates Validation (by design, TP-01); Coverage certification (`assess`) and Certification engine are distinct, non-overlapping surfaces. No harmful overlap. |
| 4 | Existing duplication | None found. Each control is single-sourced. CCE adds none. |
| 5 | Existing enforcement points | `enforce_acceptance` (validation gate), `assess(strict=True)` (coverage G4), `CertificationEngine.certify` (fail-closed), `CoverageHealth.probe(strict=True)`. |
| 6 | Existing certification gates | Coverage G4 (`CoverageCertification`); Certification criteria suite; Program Closure A1–A10. |
| 7 | Existing coverage mechanisms | `CoverageEngine` (compute/verify/reconcile/fingerprint/report); 8-tier spine; `CoverageHealth` (9 checks). |
| 8 | Existing validation mechanisms | `ValidationEngine` + 7 checks; blocking/advisory severity; deterministic report. |
| 9 | Existing readiness mechanisms | `evaluate_readiness` → `CertificationReadiness` (5 indicators). |
| 10 | Existing dependency-closure mechanisms | `DependencyClosureCheck` (single-root, digest-pinned) + `ValidationSubject.dependency_closure`. |

**Net gap addressed by CCE:** unification only. CCE closes the "no single completeness authority" gap **without** creating any new completeness computation.

---

## SECTION 11 — CERTIFICATION MODEL

CCE certification is **derived and fail-closed**: `COMPLETE` iff all ten gates CLOSED, aggregated exactly as `engine/certification/closure.py::build_program_closure` aggregates A1–A10 (all-PASS → PASS). The determination is recorded as an immutable `CertificationRecord`-shaped record and appended to the append-only, hash-chained `CertificationLedger`, making it tamper-evident and reproducible. It confers no constitutional finality (DE-05).

---

## SECTION 12 — READINESS MODEL

CCE reuses `evaluate_readiness` verbatim for Gate 8: a target is completeness-ready iff `certified`, `no-blocking-failures`, `evidence-present`, `record-integrity`, and `version-pinned` all hold (zero blockers). CCE defines no new readiness indicators; it consumes the certified five.

---

## SECTION 13 — FAILURE CONDITIONS

CCE completeness **FAILS** (`NOT COMPLETE`, emits Gap Report, halts) when any holds — see Constitution §"Failure Conditions". Summary: open architectural gap · coverage below threshold or non-deterministic · dependency closure incomplete · any blocking validation failure · missing evidence · incomplete traceability · incomplete readiness · unmet certification requirement · any open gate · broken ledger chain · unresolved dimension source.
