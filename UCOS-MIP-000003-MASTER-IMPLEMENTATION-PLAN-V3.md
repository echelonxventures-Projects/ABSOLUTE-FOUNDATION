# UCOS Ω∞ — MASTER IMPLEMENTATION PLAN v3 (SELF-EVOLVING CONSTITUTIONAL SUBSTRATE)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| ARTIFACT ID | `UCOS-MIP-000003` |
| ARTIFACT | Master Implementation Plan v3 — Constitutional Evolution Amendment assimilated |
| **STATUS** | **PROPOSED · UNRATIFIED.** `UCOS-MIP-000002` (v2) **remains the governing instrument** until Root Authority + Constitution Admin ratify this version under MIP Part 3. |
| PREDECESSOR | `UCOS-MIP-000002` — MIP v2, registered `UCOS-UCOSOMEGAINF-000001`, digest `0fbbf76fdc4f8999` |
| **AUTHORITY** | **NONE — DERIVED.** This document proposes; it does not legislate. |
| BASELINE | HEAD `e678f53eb71a` · branch `integration/recovery-001` |
| DERIVED FROM | `UCOS-CEA-000001` (assimilation) + measured Repository Truth |
| GOVERNING LAW | LAW Ω∞-000 (unchanged) |
| PARTS | 50 carried forward **by reference, unmodified** + 1 admitted (Part 51) |
| DELIVERABLES | 3 (MIP updated version) · 8 (Reality/Existence) · 9 (Context) · 10 (Dynamic Structure) · 11 (Nucleus Evolution) · 12 (Commerce Composition) |

> **Regeneration doctrine.** MIP v2 declares the anti-duplication directive and marks inherited fields **⟳ inherited** rather than reprinting them. This version applies that directive to itself: **Parts 1–50 are carried forward verbatim by reference** and are not reproduced. Reprinting 2,785 lines to change nine of them would be the exact duplication v2 forbids, and would break the digest by which v2 is registered. What follows is the **delta**, stated in full, plus the five constitutional models the amendment requires.

## §A — WHAT CHANGES FROM v2, AND WHY

| # | Change | Kind | Driver | Owner act? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | **LAW Ω∞-000** — unchanged. Seven properties stand. | none | — | — |
| A2 | **Directives D1–D25** — unchanged, immutable. | none | — | — |
| A3 | **+D26 Disclosed Closure** | extension | P1 assimilated form | Yes |
| A4 | **+D27 Physically Situated** | extension | P3 (new capability) | Yes |
| A5 | **+D28 Measured Jurisdiction** | extension | CEA-RC-01 · EK-05 | Yes |
| A6 | **Universal Coordinates: 5 declared axes → reconciled with 20 implemented axes** | correction | `engine/context/location.py` | Yes |
| A7 | **Sovereign Universe Catalog: 28 → 29** (`U29 Physical Law`) | extension | P3 | Yes |
| A8 | **Constitutional Lifecycle: 45 → 49 stages** | extension | P8 | Yes (`UCIC-001`) |
| A9 | **+Part 51 — Universal Physical Law Framework** | extension | P3 | Yes |
| A10 | **Cross-Cutting Capability Contract gains `situate()` and `disclose()`** | extension | D26, D27 | Yes |
| A11 | **Per-Part Structure Contract gains a 25th field: `JURISDICTION` (population + coverage)** | extension | D28 | Yes |

**Removed: nothing.** No part, universe, directive or law of v2 is withdrawn. The amendment adds; it does not subtract. This is itself a finding — a regeneration that deleted nothing is evidence that v2's architecture was not the constraint.

---

## §B — THE THREE ADMITTED DIRECTIVES

| # | Directive | Statement | Enforcement surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D26** | **Disclosed Closure** | No enumeration may be closed **silently**. Every closed enumeration in code or data names the invariant that closes it and the path by which a member is admitted. Closure itself is permitted and sometimes required — closure of the *question set* is what keeps every *answer vocabulary* open. | `ISD-L-01` (integrity) **+ `ISD-L-11` (completeness, to be admitted)** — `engine/infinite_scope/contract.py` |
| **D27** | **Physically Situated** | No entity assumes a physical regime. Gravity, physical constants, material behaviour and environmental conditions are **registered authority references resolved from a reference frame**, never literals in code. A civilisation whose physics differs is a JSON object. | Part 51 · `physical` axis in `AXIS_DERIVATION` · `U29` |
| **D28** | **Measured Jurisdiction** | No conformance, maturity, coverage or openness claim may be published without the size of the population it was measured over. A percentage without a denominator is not a measurement. | `JURISDICTION` field on every part · `EK-05` |

**D28 exists because of what this cycle found.** `infinite-scope-gate` reports *"no closure undisclosed"* while auditing 9 of 264 located closures, and `make constitution` reports 100% conformance over 7 of 110 discovered capabilities. Both statements are true and both are misleading, and no directive in v2 forbade that.

---

## §C — UNIVERSAL COORDINATES (CORRECTED)

MIP v2 declares a **five-axis** universal coordinate: SPACE · TIME · SCALE · OBSERVER · PERSPECTIVE. The implementation resolves **twenty** axes in a declared derivation order. These were never reconciled, so the blueprint's coordinate and the engine's coordinate are two models.

**v3 determination: the five axes are the *constitutional* coordinate; the twenty are its *resolution*.** They are bound as follows, and the binding is the thing a gate can check.

| MIP axis | Resolved by (`AXIS_DERIVATION`) | Bounds |
|---|---|---|
| SPACE | `existence` → `reality` → `universe` · `civilization` → `location` → `spatial` | Unbounded |
| TIME | `temporal` · `calendar` · `time-standard` | Unbounded |
| SCALE | `location` frame chain (`universal → planetary → physical`) | Unbounded |
| OBSERVER | `observer` | Open set |
| PERSPECTIVE | `reality` · `execution-context` | Open set |
| **— (admitted)** | **`physical`** *(D27)* | Unbounded |
| **— (admitted)** | **`culture`** | Open set |

**Standing defect this exposes.** `ContextKind` declares **15** universal context kinds; `AXIS_GRAPH` resolves **20** axes; six kinds (`computational`, `cultural`, `environmental`, `identity`, `knowledge`, `security`) resolve through **no** axis, and three more (`economic`, `linguistic`, `regulatory`) resolve only through differently-named axes with **no asserted crosswalk**. v3 requires the crosswalk to be computed, not assumed (`WP-B1`).

---

## §D — SOVEREIGN UNIVERSE CATALOG: THE 29th

| # | Universe | Primary concern | Defined in |
|---|---|---|---|
| U01–U28 | *(unchanged from v2)* | — | — |
| **U29** | **Physical Law** | The physical regime an entity exists under: constants, forces, materials, environmental conditions and the constraints they impose | **Part 51** |

**Why a universe and not a part-local model.** Physical regime is consumed by Simulation (U26), Reality Modeling (Part 26), Metering (U10 — a unit is meaningless without the regime that defines it), Compliance (U14) and every generated runtime. A concern consumed by five universes and owned by none is the definition of a sovereign universe under v2's own catalog rule.

**Why it is not a nucleus alone.** It is *also* a nucleus (`physical-law`, `SEED_NUCLEI` 43 → 44). The universe is the constitutional concern; the nucleus is its registered structural owner. v2 already holds both layers for all 28.

---

## §E — PART 51 — UNIVERSAL PHYSICAL LAW FRAMEWORK

Rendered in the 24-field per-part contract, plus the admitted 25th (`JURISDICTION`).

| Field | Determination |
|---|---|
| **PURPOSE** | Make the physical regime of an existence **representable, governable and resolvable**, so that no entity, unit, measurement, simulation or generated runtime carries an unstated physical assumption. |
| **SCOPE** | Physical constants · forces · material behaviour · environmental conditions · derived physical constraints. **Out of scope:** the numeric values themselves — this framework governs *references to* registered physical authorities, never literals. |
| **CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS** | LAW Ω∞-000 (all seven) · **D27** · D4 (not Earth-only) · D6 (no current-tech assumption) |
| **ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES** | (1) A physical value is an authority reference (`physical.a1-standard`), never a literal. (2) The regime is **location-determined**: `("physical", (LOCATION,))`. (3) An unstated regime resolves to `UNRESOLVED` — a stated unknown, never an assumed default. (4) No function branches on a regime name. |
| **CORE COMPONENTS** | `physical` axis in `AXIS_DERIVATION` · `physical-law` nucleus · physical authority references on reference frames · resolution through the existing frame chain |
| **REGISTRIES** | Reuses `engine/context/catalog/reference-frames.json` and the universal registry. **No new registry** — a new one would breach `CAA-INV-04` (`ISD-BND-05`). |
| **UNIVERSES** | U29 (owner); consumed by U10, U14, U26, and Parts 25/26/45/46/47/48/49 |
| **CAPABILITIES** | `resolve_physical_regime(frame)` · `physical_constraints(entity)` · regime conformance check |
| **DEPENDENCIES** | Part 5 (Constitutional Universe) · Part 16 (Runtime Kernel) · Part 26 (Reality Modeling) · `engine/context/location.py` |
| **COMPOSITION MODEL** | A composition inherits the regime of the frame it is instantiated in; a composition spanning frames declares regime translation or is refused. |
| **RUNTIME MODEL** | Resolution only. Clock-free, pure over `(frame, axis graph)`, deterministic. |
| **GOVERNANCE MODEL** | ⟳ inherited (U03). Regime registration is a governed act by the `engine/context/` owner. |
| **SECURITY · MONITORING · METERING · BILLING · AUDIT · COMPLIANCE · CERTIFICATION** | ⟳ inherited from the Cross-Cutting Capability Contract |
| **AUTONOMOUS GENERATION MODEL** | A generated universe inherits its parent frame's regime by default and may declare its own; it may never omit one. |
| **EVOLUTION MODEL** | Append-only. A new regime is a frame registration. Constants are versioned by the authority that owns them, never edited in place. |
| **SUCCESS CRITERIA** | `physical ∈ AXIS_GRAPH` · every registered frame declares `physical` or inherits it · zero physical literals in `engine/`, `platform/` · `physical-law` nucleus registered and owning exactly one concept |
| **IMPLEMENTATION READINESS CRITERIA** | `WP-B1` (crosswalk gate) discharged · `engine/context/` owner has admitted the axis · `UCOS-NUC-001` owner has admitted the nucleus |
| **JURISDICTION** *(new)* | Population: 14 registered frames. Coverage at baseline: **0 / 14 = 0%**. This is the honest starting number and D28 requires it to be published. |

## §F — DELIVERABLE 8 · UNIVERSAL REALITY / EXISTENCE MODEL

**Already in force. Not proposed — measured.**

```
existence           (axis root, requires nothing)
   ↓
reality             actual · modelled · simulated · planned · hypothetical
   ↓
├── observer        who observes, from what vantage, with what epistemic access
├── civilization    an open registration; alpha, beta, … n
└── universe        observable-alpha, modelled-beta, … n
        ↓
      location      the frame chain
```

**Registered population at baseline — `engine/context/catalog/reference-frames.json`, 14 frames:**

| Frame | Kind | Parent |
|---|---|---|
| `unresolved` | abstract | — |
| `existence-actual` | universal | `unresolved` |
| `existence-simulated` | simulated | `unresolved` |
| `civilization-alpha` | universal | `existence-actual` |
| `civilization-beta` | universal | `existence-simulated` |
| `planetary-a1` | planetary | `civilization-alpha` |
| `planetary-a1-region-r7` | physical | `planetary-a1` |
| `planetary-b4` | planetary | `civilization-alpha` |
| `planetary-b4-settlement-alpha` | physical | `planetary-b4` |
| `orbital-station-o2` | orbital | `civilization-alpha` |
| `virtual-realm-v9` | virtual | `civilization-beta` |
| `distributed-mesh-d3` | distributed | `civilization-beta` |
| `interstellar-corridor-i1` | interstellar | `civilization-alpha` |
| `partial-frame-p0` | abstract | `civilization-alpha` |

**Three properties worth stating, because they are what the amendment asked for and they already hold:**

1. **`frame_kind` is an open string that nothing tests.** `physical, digital, virtual, simulated, distributed, planetary, orbital, interplanetary, interstellar, galactic, universal, or something nobody has named` — an unknown kind costs nothing.
2. **No frame is named Earth or Mars.** The amendment's `Earth → Nucleus, Mars → Alpha` renaming is not a migration to perform; it is the naming discipline already in force.
3. **Each existence carries its own economics, governance, language, time and units.** `planetary-a1` declares `calendar.a1-solar`, `currency.a1-standard`, `governance.a1-representative`, `jurisdiction.a1-federal`, `language.a1-common`, `tax.a1-value-added`, `time.a1-mean-solar`, `units.a1-metric` — fourteen axis values, every one a reference to a registered authority, none a literal.

**Gap:** no frame declares a `physical` regime, because the axis does not exist (§E).

---

## §G — DELIVERABLE 9 · UNIVERSAL CONTEXT MODEL

**Fifteen universal context kinds** — universal meaning *always present*: absence is an explicit unknown, never a missing kind.

`existence · reality · observer · temporal · spatial · identity · governance · security · knowledge · computational · environmental · economic · regulatory · linguistic · cultural`

**Five authority tiers, totally ordered** so composition never resolves a conflict by arbitrary order: `constitutional (0) → architectural (1) → operational (2) → observed (3) → inferred (4)`. Two assertions of equal authority that disagree are **refused, not merged**.

**Twenty resolvable axes in a cycle-free derivation order** (`existence → reality → {observer, civilization, universe} → location → {spatial, jurisdiction, calendar, time-standard, language, units} → {temporal, governance, currency, regulation} → {tax, policy} → execution-context`).

**The model's central discipline, quoted because it is the whole answer to the amendment's Principle 3:**

> *"An axis value is a REFERENCE to a registered authority, not a semantic literal. `calendar.gregorian` names a calendar authority; the resolver never interprets it, never parses it, and never branches on it. **Replacing every value below with values from a civilisation nobody has met requires no code change.**"*

**Measured completeness — the JURISDICTION of this model (D28):**

| | Count | |
|---|---|---|
| Universal context kinds declared | 15 | |
| Axes resolvable | 20 | |
| Kinds with a same-named axis | 6 | `existence, reality, observer, temporal, spatial, governance` |
| Kinds resolving via a differently-named axis, **crosswalk unasserted** | 3 | `economic→currency+tax`, `linguistic→language`, `regulatory→regulation` |
| **Kinds resolving through no axis at all** | **6** | `computational, cultural, environmental, identity, knowledge, security` |
| **Coverage** | **6 / 15 = 40%** proven, 9 / 15 = 60% claimed | |

**v3 requires:** admit `physical` and `culture` axes; compute the kind↔axis crosswalk as a gate; declare any remaining kind explicitly unresolvable **with a reason**, which is the model's own discipline for stated unknowns.

---

## §H — DELIVERABLE 10 · DYNAMIC STRUCTURE MODEL

The amendment asks that nothing be permanently named or structurally fixed. Measured: this is in force, and enforced by a mechanism stronger than naming discipline.

| Property | Mechanism | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **One record type, not three** | `Nucleus`, `Layer` and `Composition` are one record distinguished by `StructuralRole` — *"three classes would mean three registries, three identifier paths and three places for a rule to be forgotten"* | `engine/nucleus/model.py` |
| **Role is derived, not declared** | `derive_role` recomputes role from the declaration's own content; **a declared role that contradicts it is refused** (`NL-06`). Classification is not a matter of who typed what. | `engine/nucleus/model.py` |
| **A future structural role costs a vocabulary registration, not a class** | roles are vocabulary terms | `engine/uckp/vocabulary.py` |
| **Identity is minted, never supplied** | `deterministic_id(kind, namespace, natural_key)` — two independent declarations of the same subject collapse onto one identity (`AC-003`) | `engine/registry/universal/identity.py` |
| **Content is sealed** | every record carries the digest of its own canonical rendering, digest field excluded | `engine/nucleus/model.py` |
| **Population is data** | *"adding, removing or re-scoping a nucleus, layer or composition is an edit to a tuple — never to a rule … the ten-thousandth nucleus costs one tuple entry"* | `engine/nucleus/catalog.py` |

**On renaming.** The amendment's `Ω Nucleus → any future naming system` is satisfied structurally: a name is a `key`/`title` field on a data tuple, and identity is a content-addressed function of `(kind, namespace, natural_key)`. Renaming is a registration, not a redesign. **The one caveat v3 records:** `natural_key` participates in identity, so a rename that changes the natural key mints a *new* identity. Renaming with continuity is therefore a **lineage act**, not a text edit — and `engine/nucleus/lineage.py` is its owner. This must be stated, because "names are configurations" read naively would licence identity loss.

---

## §I — DELIVERABLE 11 · NUCLEUS EVOLUTION MODEL

**Baseline population: 43 nuclei · 14 layers · 26 compositions.** Each nucleus owns **exactly one canonical concept** — *"a nucleus that owned two would be two nuclei."*

```
LAYER          owns nothing. 14 governed architecture-layer terms, reused verbatim
               from engine/uckp/vocabulary.py — not a second layer model.
  │
NUCLEUS        owns exactly one canonical concept, and every capability over it.
               43 registered: identity, identifier, geography, location, context, time,
               calendar, language, translation, currency, units, measurement, tax,
               jurisdiction, regulation, governance, policy, ownership, security, trust,
               knowledge, learning, intelligence, registry, lineage, evidence, validation,
               certification, lifecycle, evolution, workflow, execution, communication,
               media, relationship, dependency, culture, economy, product, catalog,
               pricing, billing, payment
  │
COMPOSITION    owns NOTHING and adds NO capability. A selection of nuclei plus configuration.
               26 registered, including every named platform and sector.
```

**The invariant that makes this constitutional rather than conventional:** `derive_role` derives the role from the presence of a selection, so **a subject that selects nuclei cannot be registered as a nucleus**, and **a subject registered as a composition cannot own a capability**. Before `engine/nucleus/catalog.py` this classification existed only in prose and nothing enforced it.

**Evolution path.**

| Act | Cost | Constituent act? |
|---|---|---|
| Register the 44th nucleus | one tuple entry + `AC-005` population disclosure | Yes — `UCOS-NUC-001` |
| Register the 27th composition | one tuple entry; selections must already be registered (`NL-08`) | No |
| Add a capability to a nucleus | one entry; `SEED_CAPABILITY_SUFFIXES` is *"one entry per nucleus … nothing here is a ceiling"* | No |
| Add a structural role | one vocabulary registration | Yes — `ISD-BND-03` |
| Rename with continuity | lineage act | Yes |

**v3 admits one nucleus: `physical-law` (43 → 44)**, owning the concept `physical-regime`, under D27.

---

## §J — DELIVERABLE 12 · COMMERCE COMPOSITION MODEL

**The amendment's Principle 6 is already the repository's own constitutional correction, and the repository states it more sharply:**

> **"Commerce is not a Nucleus. Commerce is a Composition."** *So are Amazon, Uber, PayTM, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, X, LinkedIn, YouTube, ERP, CRM, LMS, EdTech, and every sector, banking, insurance, healthcare, government, defence, industrial, scientific, research and civilisational platform.*

**Registered compositions, verbatim from `SEED_COMPOSITIONS`:**

| Composition | Selected nuclei | n |
|---|---|---|
| **commerce** | catalog · product · pricing · payment · billing · tax · currency · jurisdiction · identity · workflow · execution · relationship · measurement | 13 |
| **amazon** | catalog · product · pricing · payment · billing · tax · currency · location · geography · identity · trust · workflow · execution · media · measurement | 15 |
| **uber** | identity · location · geography · time · pricing · payment · billing · tax · workflow · execution · communication · trust · measurement | 13 |
| **paytm** | identity · payment · billing · pricing · currency · tax · jurisdiction · regulation · security · trust · execution | 11 |
| **x** | identity · communication · media · relationship · policy · measurement | 6 |

Plus 21 more: `retail · marketplace · whatsapp · facebook · instagram · linkedin · youtube · erp · crm · lms · edtech · consultancy-platform · banking-platform · insurance-platform · healthcare-platform · government-platform · defence-platform · industrial-platform · scientific-platform · research-platform · civilizational-platform`.

**Reconciliation with the amendment's illustrative tree.** The amendment renders Commerce as 17 children including *Search, Cart, Checkout, Listing, Logistics, Inventory, Customer, Analytics, Governance, Evolution*. Measured against the registered model:

| Amendment child | Disposition |
|---|---|
| Product · Catalog · Pricing · Payment · Tax · Billing · Identity | **Registered nuclei** — selected by `commerce` |
| Governance · Evolution | **Registered nuclei**, and also sovereign universes U03/U28 — inherited by every composition through the Cross-Cutting Capability Contract, so selecting them explicitly is redundant, not absent |
| Analytics | **U16**, inherited |
| Listing · Search · Cart · Checkout · Logistics · Inventory · Customer | **Not registered.** Search is U22 (sovereign). The other six are **capabilities of registered nuclei**, not nuclei: Cart and Checkout are `workflow` capabilities; Listing is a `catalog` capability; Inventory is a `measurement`+`product` capability; Logistics is an `execution`+`location` capability; Customer is an `identity`+`relationship` capability. |

**v3 determination: none of these is a gap in the composition model.** They are unregistered *capabilities*, and `SEED_CAPABILITY_SUFFIXES` is explicitly *"one entry per nucleus … further capabilities are registered against a nucleus at any time; nothing here is a ceiling."* Registering them is `WP-E`, and it is a registration act, not an architectural one — which is precisely the property the amendment demanded and the model already has.

---

## §K — CROSS-CUTTING CAPABILITY CONTRACT (EXTENDED)

v2's 22 interfaces, unchanged, plus two:

`register() · describe() · compose(with) · govern() · secure() · monitor() · observe() · meter() · bill() · audit() · prove() · comply() · certify() · discover() · search() · remember() · know() · reason() · simulate() · compile() · evolve() · explain()` **· `situate()` · `disclose()`**

| New interface | Obligation | Directive |
|---|---|---|
| `situate()` | Return the reference frame this universe resolves against, and every axis value it inherits or declares — including `physical`. A universe that cannot situate itself cannot be metered, because a unit without a regime is not a measurement. | D27 |
| `disclose()` | Return every closed enumeration this universe owns, each with its closing invariant and admission path. A universe that closes an enumeration and does not disclose it fails admission. | D26 |

**`disclose()` is what converts D26 from a document into a gate.** `ISD-L-11` becomes the aggregate of every universe's `disclose()` against the located population — the completeness measure `ISD-L-01` structurally cannot compute alone.

---

## §L — CONSTITUTIONAL LIFECYCLE (45 → 49)

Four stages admitted into the `CORRECTION` group between `UCL-S-0210 Challenge` and `UCL-S-0220 Correct`, using the ordinal gap the manifest reserves.

| id | stage | group | depends_on | owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `UCL-S-0212` | Predict | CORRECTION | `UCL-S-0210` | `engine/graph/architecture/impact.py` |
| `UCL-S-0214` | Simulate | CORRECTION | `UCL-S-0212` | `engine/uaue/simulation.py` |
| `UCL-S-0216` | Evaluate Alternatives | CORRECTION | `UCL-S-0214` | `engine/uaue/planning.py` |
| `UCL-S-0218` | Optimize | CORRECTION | `UCL-S-0216` | `engine/compiler/optimization.py` |

`UCL-S-0220 Correct` re-points `depends_on` to `UCL-S-0218`. **No existing ordinal moves.** Non-terminality is unaffected: `UCL-S-0450` still `reenters: UCL-S-0010`.

**Mandatory prior disclosure (D28).** Stage population 45 → 49 changes the denominator of every stage-coverage measure and of `criteria=40/42`. The new denominators must be published *before* the extension lands.

---

## §M — FINAL COMPLETION CRITERIA (v3 ADDENDUM TO PART 50)

v2's Part 50 stands. v3 adds three criteria, each of which is currently **unmet and measured**:

| # | Criterion | Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| **C51** | Every located closed enumeration is disclosed or opened. | **9 / 264 = 3.4%** |
| **C52** | Every universal context kind resolves through at least one axis, or is declared unresolvable with a reason. | **6 / 15 = 40%** proven |
| **C53** | Every registered subject that is commercially applicable is identified by `deterministic_id`, and its commercial coverage is published with its denominator. | **0%** — `CommercialTarget.target_id` is a free string |

*Proposed. Unratified. `UCOS-MIP-000002` governs until Root Authority + Constitution Admin act.*
