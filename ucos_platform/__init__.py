"""UCOS EC-2 ``platform`` package root — stdlib-safe shim.

The EC-2 Platform Realization Program's authoritative deliverable path is
``platform/foundation/`` (per ``06-IMPLEMENTATION/UCOS-EC-2-PLATFORM-REALIZATION-PROGRAM.md``).
Because ``platform`` is also the name of a Python standard-library module, a naive
package here would *shadow* the stdlib module for the whole interpreter and break
tooling (pytest, coverage, setuptools all ``import platform``).

To honor the mandated deliverable path **without** breaking the toolchain, this
package is a **transparent shim**: it loads the genuine standard-library
``platform`` module by file location and re-exports its public API into this
package namespace. Therefore:

    * ``import platform``            → exposes the real stdlib API (``system()``,
      ``python_version()``, ``machine()``, …) — tooling is unaffected;
    * ``import ucos_platform.foundation`` → resolves the EC-2 Platform Foundation, because
      this remains a real package with a ``__path__``.

This shim is additive and reads nothing from the certified corpus. It is *not* an
EC-2 foundation module; it exists solely to reconcile the reserved package name.
