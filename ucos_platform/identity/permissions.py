"""EC2-TASK-000066 — Permission Engine (EC2-EPIC-002).

Resolves the **effective permissions** a principal holds on a capability group by
composing the grants of every role the principal bears (§3.2). It is a pure,
deterministic function of the :class:`~platform.identity.roles.RoleRegistry` and the
principal's roles — it enforces no invariants and makes no allow/deny decision
(that is the policy engine); it answers only *"what verbs does this principal hold
here, and under what scope?"*

Resolution rules (deterministic, least-privilege by construction):
    * The effective permission set is the **union** of the matching role grants —
      holding several roles never removes access, only adds it.
    * ``ADMINISTER`` is the top verb and **implies** ``CREATE``, ``READ`` and
      ``EXECUTE`` (an administrator of a group can do everything in it).
    * A group is **scoped** for a principal only if *every* contributing role grant
      is scoped; a single unscoped grant makes the effective access unscoped.
    * The **attest** obligation is carried if *any* contributing grant carries it.
    * A principal with no matching grant on a group resolves to the **empty** set
      (no access) — never an error.
