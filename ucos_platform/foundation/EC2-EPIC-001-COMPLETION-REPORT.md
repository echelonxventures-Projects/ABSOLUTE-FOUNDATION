# EC2-EPIC-001 — Platform Foundation — Completion Report

**Program:** EC-2 Platform Realization Program · **Epic:** EC2-EPIC-001 (Platform Foundation)
**Scope executed:** EC2-TASK-000055 · EC2-TASK-000056 · EC2-TASK-000057 · EC2-TASK-000058 ·
EC2-TASK-000059 · EC2-TASK-000060 · EC2-TASK-000061 · EC2-TASK-000062 (inclusive)
**Authoritative basis:** `06-IMPLEMENTATION/UCOS-EC-2-PLATFORM-REALIZATION-PROGRAM.md`
(§2 Platform Definition, §3 User Model, §4 Platform Architecture, §5 Epic Determination,
§8 TRACK-001). Builds on the **certified EC-1 Realization Engine** (54/54 tasks, A1–A10 PASS,
Program Closure Certification PASS).
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — all eight tasks delivered, verified, and gated.

> Additive engineering package `platform/foundation/`. It establishes the reusable
> foundational framework every subsequent EC-2 epic builds on, as a strictly
> **additive** layer over the certified EC-1 engine: it consumes EC-1 only through
> published contracts, **modifies no EC-1 module**, **never writes to the certified
> corpus** (DP-03), and preserves determinism end to end. **Foundation only** — no
> UI, portal, workspace, dashboard, or runtime operation is implemented.

## 1. Objective & constraints — conformance

| Constraint | How satisfied | Evidence |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| Additive only | new `platform/foundation/` package; 0 modifications to EC-1 `engine/**` | §4; git change set = `platform/**` + `pyproject.toml` |
| Registry-only access | the foundation defines the EC-1 consumption seam by **contract reference** (`ENGINE_CONTRACTS`) and performs no direct corpus/registry access; the L4 façade (future epics) binds those contracts to EC-1's read-only adapter | `contracts.py`, `capabilities.py` |
| Deterministic principles (IMP-007 §5) | canonical hashing; content-addressed identities; stable ordering (services, dependencies, capabilities, events); no wall-clock in the event model; identical inputs ⇒ identical bootstrap fingerprint | §6 |
| Additive-only evolution | reuses EC-1 `FoundationError`, `Version`/`Contract`/`ContractRegistry`, `Config`/`SecretRef`/`load_config`, obs logging/telemetry/context verbatim | `errors.py`, `contracts.py`, `config.py`, `events.py`, `bootstrap.py` |
| No modification of certified EC-1 | zero edits under `engine/`; EC-1 + certification suites re-run green | §5 |
| No UI / portal / workspace / dashboard / runtime | none present; bootstrap composes the foundation only and starts nothing | `bootstrap.py` scope guardrail |

## 2. Task-by-task delivery

| Task | Deliverable | Module |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **EC2-TASK-000055** | Platform contracts — versioned platform contract surface reusing EC-1 `Version`/`Contract`/`ContractRegistry`; `ContractRef`; canonical `canonical_json`/`content_hash`; the `ENGINE_CONTRACTS` set (the EC-1 capabilities the platform may consume); `PlatformError` taxonomy (`EC2-*`) | `contracts.py`, `errors.py` |
| **EC2-TASK-000056** | Platform configuration — typed, immutable `PlatformConfig` wrapping the EC-1 loader; secrets by reference only (SEC-04); deterministic redacted `fingerprint()` | `config.py` |
| **EC2-TASK-000057** | Platform identity model — `Role` (the nine §3 user categories), `Permission` (C/R/X/A), immutable content-addressed `Principal`; scoped/read-only role sets | `identity.py` |
| **EC2-TASK-000058** | Platform service registry — deterministic, additive `ServiceRegistry` + `ServiceDescriptor`; contract-first registration; lazy/memoized resolution; dependency-honest `startup_order` | `services.py` |
| **EC2-TASK-000059** | Platform dependency model — `DependencyGraph` with deterministic topological ordering (Kahn + lexicographic tie-break), cycle detection (AR-01), closure honesty | `dependencies.py` |
| **EC2-TASK-000060** | Platform event model — immutable, content-addressed `PlatformEvent` (no wall-clock); synchronous, append-only `EventBus` with filtered dispatch and correlation-id binding | `events.py` |
| **EC2-TASK-000061** | Platform capability model — `Capability`/`CapabilityCatalog`; the encoded **EC-1 ↔ EC-2 boundary**: 13 certified engine capabilities (each bound to an engine contract) + 18 platform-native capabilities (PC-01…PC-18) | `capabilities.py` |
| **EC2-TASK-000062** | Platform bootstrap architecture — deterministic `bootstrap_platform() -> PlatformContext` composing config + contracts + services + capabilities + events; fail-closed; reproducible `fingerprint()` | `bootstrap.py` |

## 3. The composed foundation

```
bootstrap_platform(config?)                       # fail-closed, deterministic
  ├── PlatformConfig            (TASK-000056)      # typed, redacted, secrets by ref
  ├── ContractRegistry          (TASK-000055)      # reused EC-1 versioning discipline
  ├── ServiceRegistry           (TASK-000058)      # contract-first; dependency-honest order
  ├── CapabilityCatalog         (TASK-000061)      # 13 engine + 18 platform, validated
  │     └── DependencyGraph     (TASK-000059)      # acyclic, deterministic ordering
  ├── EventBus                  (TASK-000060)      # append-only; emits bootstrap event
  └── → PlatformContext         (TASK-000062)      # shared by every future EC-2 epic
          .fingerprint()  → deterministic content hash of the composition
```

Every EC-2 epic receives a `PlatformContext` and registers its services/capabilities
into these registries — the foundation is the reusable substrate, never the feature.

### The EC-1 ↔ EC-2 boundary (encoded)
The 13 certified EC-1 capabilities are modeled as `CapabilityKind.ENGINE` capabilities,
each bound to a versioned engine contract reference (Registry Resolution, Blueprint
Classification, Compilation, Deterministic Build, Signing, SBOM, Runtime Assembly,
Deployment Descriptor, Rollback Descriptor, Factory Generation, Validation,
Certification, Certification Ledger). The platform consumes them by reference only —
it re-implements none and modifies none.

pyproject.toml                               (MODIFIED) coverage/testpaths/packages += platform.foundation
```

No file under `00-BOOK/`, `00-SOURCE/`, or `99-FREEZE/`, and no file under `engine/`,
was created or modified.

### Note — the reserved package name `platform`
`platform` is also a Python standard-library module. To honor the mandated deliverable
path `platform/foundation/` **without** shadowing the stdlib (which would break
pytest, coverage, and setuptools), `platform/__init__.py` is a **transparent shim**:
it loads the genuine stdlib `platform` module by file location and re-exports its
public API, while remaining a real package so `platform.foundation` imports. Verified:
`import platform` still returns the stdlib API (`system()`, `python_version()`, …) and
`import ucos_platform.foundation` resolves the EC-2 foundation.

## 5. Verification evidence

Commands run in the pinned dev environment (`.ec1-venv`):

**Lint (ruff):** `ruff check engine platform` → **All checks passed!**

**Tests + coverage gate (`--cov-fail-under=90`):**
```
552 passed
Required test coverage of 90% reached. Total coverage: 99.74%

platform/foundation/__init__.py       100%
platform/foundation/bootstrap.py      100%
platform/foundation/capabilities.py   100%
platform/foundation/config.py         100%
platform/foundation/contracts.py      100%
platform/foundation/dependencies.py   100%
platform/foundation/errors.py         100%
platform/foundation/events.py         100%
platform/foundation/identity.py       100%
platform/foundation/services.py       100%
```
**100% coverage on every `platform/foundation` module.** The full EC-1 + certification
suites are included in the 552 and remain green (EC-1 integrity preserved).

**Build:** `python -m build` → wheel + sdist built; the `platform` shim and all 8
`platform/foundation/**` modules packaged (tests excluded).

**stdlib safety:** `import platform` → `Darwin`, `python_version()` intact under the shim.

**Frozen-path guard (DP-03)** over the EC2-EPIC-001 change set: exit 0 (clean).

## 6. Determinism evidence

```
bootstrap_platform()  →  program_id=EC-2  platform_name="UCOS Platform"
capabilities = 31  (engine=13 · platform=18)
fingerprint (run A) = 2941e8ae287beb0a…    fingerprint (run B) = 2941e8ae287beb0a…    (identical)
bootstrap event      = platform.bootstrap.completed  (UCOS-EVT-…, sequence 0)
```
Two independent bootstraps of the same configuration produced an identical
`PlatformContext.fingerprint()`; principals, events, service order, and capability
order are all content-addressed / stably ordered — reproducible by construction.

## 7. Acceptance criteria (EC2-EPIC-001) matrix

| Requirement (Program §5) | Status | Evidence |
|--------------------------|--------|----------|
| Foundational framework reusable by all subsequent epics | ✅ | `PlatformContext` + registries; `bootstrap.py` |
| Platform contracts (versioned, AR-03/PL-05) | ✅ | `contracts.py`; `test_contracts.py` |
| Platform configuration (secrets by reference) | ✅ | `config.py`; `test_config.py` |
| Platform identity model (9 roles, C/R/X/A) | ✅ | `identity.py`; `test_identity.py` |

| Platform event model (append-only, deterministic) | ✅ | `events.py`; `test_events.py` |
| Platform capability model (EC-1 ↔ EC-2 boundary) | ✅ | `capabilities.py`; `test_capabilities.py` |
| Platform bootstrap architecture (deterministic composition) | ✅ | `bootstrap.py`; `test_bootstrap.py` |
| Additive; EC-1 unmodified; no frozen-corpus writes; foundation-only | ✅ | §1, §5 |

## 8. Success criterion

Proven: **the EC-2 Platform Foundation exists as a reusable, deterministic, additive
substrate** — versioned contracts, typed configuration, an identity model, a service
registry, a dependency model, an event model, a capability model encoding the EC-1 ↔
EC-2 boundary, and a fail-closed bootstrap that composes them into a reproducible
`PlatformContext`. It consumes the certified EC-1 engine only by contract reference,
modifies no EC-1 component, writes nothing to the certified corpus, and implements no
UI/portal/workspace/dashboard/runtime. It carries no constitutional authority; the
external gates (EC-1…EC-6) remain open.

**STOP — EC2-EPIC-001 complete. EC2-TASK-000055…EC2-TASK-000062 delivered. EC2-EPIC-002
(Identity & Access) not begun.**
