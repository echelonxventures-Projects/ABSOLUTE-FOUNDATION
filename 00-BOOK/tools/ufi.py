UCOS Ω∞ — Universal Formal Independence framework (UFI).

WHAT THIS IS FOR. MB7: a producer validated only by its own programme cannot be shown
to be CORRECT, only CONSISTENT. Measured across this repository: `validation_owner`
equals `owner` for every entry of the generated-artifact registry, no producer has a
single test inside its own home, and 14 of 33 producers have no validator anywhere.
A producer that is uniformly wrong emits self-consistent output and every check derived
from that run agrees with it.

UCOS-UCTX-001 was closed against that defect by an independent verifier. This module is
that verifier with the capability taken out of it. It exists so the second producer to
adopt formal independence writes a DECLARATION rather than a second verifier — a
repository with 33 hand-written verifiers has 33 new things that can be uniformly wrong,
which is the defect again with more files.

WHAT IS SHARED AND WHAT MAY NEVER BE. The CODE is shared: one implementation of the
three checks, one place a bug is fixed, one place an attack is measured. The AUTHORITY
is never shared. Each adopter names its own authorities and its own template manifest,
and this module holds no list of either. A shared authority source would make every
adopter's truth a projection of one instrument, which is the rival-authority failure
UCKP-ART-03 voids — the opposite of what independence means.

THE THREE CHECKS, AND WHY THREE.

  CHECK 1 — PROVENANCE. Every emitted LINE traces to a declared source: a reviewed
    template in the adopter's manifest, or a string one of the adopter's declared
    authorities already holds. A sentence the generator invents is in neither.

  CHECK 2 — RECORD INTEGRITY. Every declared record is projected WHOLE. Provenance asks
    only whether a cell traces to SOME declared string, which admits keeping every cell
    and changing which record it sits with. Cells sharing a row must reconcile with one
    record; a page named after a record may not display another record's values.

  CHECK 3 — COMPLETENESS. Every declared obligation is CARRIED. Checks 1 and 2 both
    reason about what was emitted, so neither can see a producer that emits LESS.

Measured on the reference adopter: of ten uniformly wrong variants, five emit no text
that is not declared. CHECK 1 alone passed all five. That is why there are three.

WHAT AN ADOPTER DECLARES. An independence declaration names three things and nothing
else — its authorities, its surfaces, and its manifest. Each may be a literal list or a
POINTER of the form {"from": <path>, "json_path": "a.b[].c"} into an instrument that
already says it. The pointer form exists so adopting this framework never re-authors a
list that a declaration already holds, which UCKP-ART-03 would void.

This module reads. It writes nothing, imports no producer, and executes none.

Usage:
    python3 00-BOOK/tools/ufi.py <independence-declaration.json>
    python3 00-BOOK/tools/ufi.py <declaration> --report   # list findings, exit 0
