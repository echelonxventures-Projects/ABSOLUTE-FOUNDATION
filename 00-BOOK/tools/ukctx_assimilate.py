"""UCOS-UCTX-001 — the context assimilation pipeline.

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH). This tool legislates nothing and decides nothing on its
own. It runs the four gates `context-authority.json :: assimilation_pipeline` declares, in
the order that instrument declares them, and refuses anything that does not pass all four.

WHAT IT IS FOR. Discussion routes IN to the proposer's own folder; implementation routes OUT
from one authority. This is the road between them, and until it existed there was no lawful
way to add context at all: hand-editing a projection is a drift failure, editing the
authority directly is an ungated mutation, and writing context somewhere unregistered is the
rival authority UCKP-ART-03 voids. A proposal is free to write and costs nothing; it simply
is not context until it has passed here.

ORDER IS THE POINT. Every check below already existed somewhere in the repository. What did
not exist was their running BEFORE the write. The generator emitted first and the gate
measured afterwards, which detects drift but cannot stop the authority absorbing a duplicate.
These four run against the MERGED result, before a byte is written.

IT CANNOT MINT ON ITS OWN. Identity allocation is irreversible and governed by REG-AUTO-001.
Without an operator permit this tool PLANS and refuses to write, which is why --plan is the
default and --assimilate must be asked for explicitly.

    python3 00-BOOK/tools/ukctx_assimilate.py              plan every discovered proposal
    python3 00-BOOK/tools/ukctx_assimilate.py --json       the plan as a record
    python3 00-BOOK/tools/ukctx_assimilate.py --assimilate merge (needs a permit)
