*Append-only extension overlay. Specifies the complete future-state Version, Configuration, and Rollback architecture, realized entirely by existing fields and structures. Creates no Version/Configuration/Baseline/Rollback Registry (UCI-001 Parts XI.5, X.5, XVI.5). Modifies no existing artifact; embeds no secret (RR-07).*

---

## 1. PURPOSE

Provide the **Universal Version Registry** and **Universal Version Lineage Engine** as derived views over existing fields — never a new store (UCI-001 Part XI). Version identity is the Artifact `universal_id` **plus** `version`; no separate version identifier namespace is created (Part XI.3).

## 2. THE VERSION MODEL (existing, reused)

| Concern | Realized by |
|---------|-------------|
| Semantic version | `version` field |
| Per-registration baseline | `content_hash` |
| Allocation history | `id-ledger.json` `first_seen` |
| Change history | git history + `Supersedes`/`Superseded-By` edges |
| New version | a new registered state of the same `native_id`, or a superseding artifact |

Version history is append-only and preserves every prior `version` and `content_hash` (UCI-001 Part XI.4). A content change without a new `content_hash` is INVALID (CL-04).

## 3. CONFIGURATION MODEL

Configuration state is the `version` + `content_hash` + `status` of the affected artifact plus `Depends-On`/`Uses` edges. A **configuration baseline** is the set of `content_hash` values pinned at `FROZEN` status; **drift** is a mismatch between recorded and freshly-computed hash — a guard failure (UCI-001 Part X; REG-AUTO-001 §16). No configuration store is created.

## 4. ROLLBACK MODEL

Rollback is a **new** governed change artifact that re-asserts a prior baseline (forward-only; never deletes history). The rolled-back artifact transitions to `SUPERSEDED`/`RETIRED`; the restored baseline registers as the new `ACTIVE` state; artifacts, registers, twin, graph, traceability, dependencies, and generated assets are restored through transaction `T` (UCI-001 Part XVI). No Rollback Registry is created.

## 5. CERTIFICATION INTERPRETATION (non-terminal)

A frozen `content_hash` pins an immutable baseline of a defined scope; it protects that scope and simultaneously **permits** append-only growth around it (new versions via supersession). Freeze protects; it does not forbid future versions (AUTH-INF-001 CR-INF-008).

## 6. INFINITE SCALE

Unlimited versions per entity; no ceiling on version count; version identifiers inherit the unbounded ID/hash space (AUTH-INF-001 CR-INF-010). New version dimensions (e.g. a future variant axis) are additive schema growth (CR-INF-008).

## 7. TRACEABILITY

Every version is reverse-traceable to the change that produced it (UMB-008), to its predecessor via `Superseded-By` (UMB-010), and to its allocation via `first_seen` — a complete, append-only version lineage.

## AUTHORITY BOUNDARY (MANDATORY)

UMB-009 holds no constituent, governance, ratification, or EC-series authority and cannot authorize EC-1. It is knowledge/registry only, append-only, subordinate to the frozen corpus, STATUS-001, REG-AUTO-001, UCI-001, AUTH-INF-001, and all prior determinations. It creates no version/config/rollback registry/engine/identifier/lifecycle, treats `00-SOURCE/`/`99-FREEZE/` as read-only, and embeds no secret (RR-07). Any conflicting statement is void to the extent of the conflict.
