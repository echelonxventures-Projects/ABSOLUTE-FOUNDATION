*Append-only extension overlay. Specifies the complete future-state Universal Identity architecture. It constitutionalizes and reuses the existing append-only ID ledger; it introduces **no new identifier namespace** beyond the already-declared `UMB` category (AUTH-INF-001 CR-INF-004.3; GOV-INT-001 §0). Modifies no existing artifact; embeds no secret (RR-07).*

## 1. IDENTITY PRECEDES EXISTENCE

No entity SHALL exist without identity; no entity SHALL exist without registration; no entity SHALL exist without traceability (AUTH-INF-001 CR-INF-004). Existence on disk without registration is a **draft**, not an entity of record (REG-AUTO-001 §5). Identity is acquired at registration through transaction `T`.

## 2. THE UNIVERSAL IDENTIFIER ENGINE (existing, reused)

The authoritative allocator is the append-only Universal ID Ledger `DATA/id-ledger.json`, form `UCOS-<CATEGORY>-NNNNNN`. It allocates once, never reuses, never renumbers, never reorders (REG-AUTO-001 P4). This engine is not re-created; UMB constitutionalizes its identities as Universal Unique Identities.

## 3. THE IDENTITY FACET SET

Every entity possesses the full identity facet set, each facet realized by an existing field/structure — never a new store:

| Facet (mission term) | Realized by |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Universal Unique ID | `id-ledger.json` `universal_id` (`UCOS-<CAT>-NNNNNN`) |
| Canonical ID | the `universal_id` itself (the stable canonical key) |
| Serial Number | the ledger allocation sequence + `first_seen` timestamp |
| Registry ID | Artifact Registry record (`artifacts.json`) |
| Version ID | `version` + `content_hash` (UMB-009) |
| Lineage ID | `Supersedes`/`Superseded-By` chain (UMB-010) |
| Authority ID | governing determination cited in the artifact header |
| Ownership ID | `program` + `parent` (owning family/root) |
| Classification ID | `category` + `volume` + `status_domain` |
| Lifecycle ID | lifecycle state (DRAFT→…→ARCHIVED; REG-AUTO-001 §5) |

Native sequence identifiers (`RUNTIME-014`, `PLATFORM-001`, `UMB-003`, …) are **crosswalk aliases** over the stable Universal ID, not identity (AUTH-INF-001 CR-INF-005; UMB-004).

## 4. IDENTITY INVARIANCE (survives everything)

Identity SHALL be stable regardless of, and SHALL survive: **renaming, reclassification, relocation, versioning, refactoring, expansion, evolution, federation, migration** (AUTH-INF-001 CR-INF-005). Because identity is sequence-independent, expanding any sequence (`UMB-021`, `NODE-1000`, a new category) disturbs no existing identity and is always non-destructive.

- **Identity never reused** (P4). **Identity never lost** — the ledger is append-only and every allocation's `first_seen` is retained forever.

## 5. ADDRESSABILITY, RESOLVABILITY, DISCOVERABILITY

Every identity is **addressable** (has a Universal ID), **resolvable** (the ledger/registry maps ID↔artifact↔native-id↔path), and **discoverable** (reachable via registry, graph, and search) — realized by the existing Artifact Registry, ID Ledger, and Knowledge Graph; no new resolver or address space is created (AUTH-INF-001 CR-INF-006).

## 6. UNLIMITED IDENTITY SCALE

No architectural ceiling on identity count exists; `NNNNNN` padding is formatting, widened append-only if a category approaches its width, renumbering nothing (AUTH-INF-001 CR-INF-002/010).

## 7. FEDERATION-READINESS

Because identity is a stable, prefixed, append-only key independent of sequence and location, multiple UCOS instances federate by namespacing categories/ledgers without collision or renumber — future work enabled by construction, asserted as **possibility, not completion** (AUTH-INF-001 Part IX non-projection).

## AUTHORITY BOUNDARY (MANDATORY)

UMB-003 holds no constituent, governance, ratification, or EC-series authority and cannot authorize EC-1. It is knowledge/registry only, append-only, subordinate to the frozen corpus, STATUS-001, REG-AUTO-001, UCI-001, AUTH-INF-001, and all prior determinations. It creates no new identifier namespace/engine/lifecycle, treats `00-SOURCE/`/`99-FREEZE/` as read-only, and embeds no secret (RR-07). Any conflicting statement is void to the extent of the conflict.
