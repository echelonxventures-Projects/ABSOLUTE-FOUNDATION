*Append-only extension overlay. Specifies the complete future-state Change architecture as the Master-Book realization of the single Change Authority UCI-001. It **owns no change semantics** — UCI-001 does; it specifies how change intelligence surfaces in the Knowledge OS. Creates no Change Registry (UCI-001 Part IX.5). Modifies no existing artifact; embeds no secret (RR-07).*

## 1. PURPOSE

Realize **Universal Change Intelligence**: every governed change automatically produces knowledge, impact, traceability, regeneration requirements, and institutional memory — **CHANGE ONCE · UNDERSTAND EVERYWHERE · SYNCHRONIZE EVERYWHERE · REGENERATE EVERYWHERE** (UCI-001 Part I.3). UCI-001 is the sole Change Authority; this document specifies its Knowledge-OS surface, adding no competing standard.

## 2. CHANGE IS AN ARTIFACT

A governed change is a first-class Universal Artifact (`category = CHG`, `UCOS-CHG-NNNNNN`), registered by transaction `T`, linked to each affected artifact by edges, and emitting at least one Signal (UCI-001 CP-1/CL-01/CL-09). No change is isolated (CP-2); every change is append-only (CP-3) and evidence-bound (CP-4).

## 3. THE FOUR CHANGE-INTELLIGENCE ENGINES (derived, not stored)

| Mission engine | Realized as | Authority |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Universal Change Intelligence Engine | `CHG` artifact + Knowledge Model content | UCI-001 Part XIII |
| Universal Impact Analysis Engine | Knowledge-Graph traversal from the change node along `Depends-On`/`Uses`/`References`/`Implements`/`Tests`/`Deploys`/`Parent`/`Child` | UCI-001 Part XII |
| Universal Dependency Analysis Engine | `Depends-On` projection traversal (DAG) | UMB-006; UCI-001 IL-13 |
| Universal Supersession Engine | `Supersedes`/`Superseded-By` edges + status transition | UCI-001 CL-07; UMB-010 |

All four are **derived views recomputed on demand**, citing traversed edges as provenance; none is persisted as a new store (UCI-001 IP-3/Part XII.4).

## 4. WHAT EVERY CHANGE CAPTURES

For every change the model captures: **What Changed · Why Changed · Who Authorized · When Changed · Previous State · Current State · Impacted Entities · Impacted Dependencies · Impacted Runtime · Impacted Security · Impacted Publications · Impacted Certifications** — as the change artifact's Knowledge Model (Problem, Reason, Decision, Alternatives, Assumptions, Expected/Actual Outcome, Lessons) plus impact traversal (UCI-001 Parts XIII, XII; IL-01…08).

## 5. REGENERATION REQUIREMENTS (derived)

Regeneration requirements for every dependent asset class (schema, ERD, DB/DDL/DML, API/OpenAPI/GraphQL, code, UI/UX, service, IaC, test, deployment, docs) are **derived** by composing impact traversal with the `traceability` field, emitted at request time to existing generators, synchronized only via `T` — no regeneration engine or registry is created (UCI-001 Part XV; GL-01…15).

## 6. ZERO HARD CODING & SELF-EVOLUTION

New impacted asset classes and new relationship types are absorbed additively (UMB-006); the change model needs no redesign to govern a not-yet-imagined asset class (AUTH-INF-001 CR-INF-008). The only permitted additive delta is the optional `change` value in the Signal `dimension` enum (UCI-001 Part II.5).

## 7. TRACEABILITY

Every change is bidirectionally traversable (no orphan change node; UCI-001 CL-08) and reversible (UMB-009/010). Impact and regeneration outputs are reproducible from the evidence base (deterministic; UCI-001 IL-14).

## AUTHORITY BOUNDARY (MANDATORY)

UMB-008 holds no constituent, governance, ratification, or EC-series authority and cannot authorize EC-1. It is knowledge/operational-intelligence only, append-only, subordinate to the frozen corpus, STATUS-001, REG-AUTO-001, UCI-001, AUTH-INF-001, and all prior determinations. It owns no change semantics (UCI-001 does), creates no registry/engine/identifier/lifecycle, treats `00-SOURCE/`/`99-FREEZE/` as read-only, and embeds no secret (RR-07). Any conflicting statement is void to the extent of the conflict.
