# UCOS Ω∞ — Canonical environment library (shared).
#
# This file is *sourced* by bootstrap.sh, doctor.sh, and verify.sh. It is the single
# source of truth for "what the repository-standard execution environment is" and how
# to make a fresh shell converge to it WITHOUT any manual `source .../activate` step.
#
# Root cause it eliminates (see ENVIRONMENT-SETUP.md §Root-Cause):
#   * "ruff: command not found" / "coverage: command not found"  -> tools were only on
#     PATH inside an activated venv; a fresh shell had none of them.
#   * "pytest: unrecognized arguments: --cov"                     -> pytest ran under an
#     interpreter that lacked pytest-cov (the addopts in pyproject require it).
#   * "verification depends on whether a specific venv was activated" -> everything here
#     invokes the venv interpreter by ABSOLUTE PATH (never relies on PATH/activation).
#
# Design invariants:
#   1. Never depend on PATH. Always call "$(ucos_venv_python) -m <tool>".
#   2. Never require the caller to activate a venv.
#   3. The venv (.ec1-venv) is disposable + .gitignored; it is self-healed to match the
#      canonical Python series and the pinned toolchain in pyproject.toml [dev].
#   4. Standard tooling only: bash + a Python interpreter + git.
#
# Overridable via environment (sane defaults; you should rarely need these):
#   UCOS_PYTHON           explicit interpreter to build the venv from (e.g. python3.12)
#   UCOS_PYTHON_SERIES    canonical "major.minor" the venv must match (default 3.12)
#   UCOS_VENV_DIR         venv location (default <repo>/.ec1-venv)
#   UCOS_ALLOW_RECREATE   1 (default) => auto-recreate a venv whose series drifted
#   UCOS_ALLOW_PYTHON_MISMATCH  1 => tolerate a non-canonical series instead of failing

# THE ROOT IS RESOLVED BY GIT, AND THIS IS A CORRECTION RATHER THAN A PREFERENCE.
#
# This function used to derive the root purely from ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} on the reasoning that
# the library lives in <repo>/scripts/, so the root is one level up. That reasoning is sound
# and the implementation was not: BASH_SOURCE is a bash array, and a shell that does not
# populate it — zsh, which is the login shell on the machine this was measured on — leaves
# the expansion empty. `dirname ""` is ".", so the root resolved to the PARENT of the
# current directory.
#
# Measured consequence (UCOS-EXECUTION-ENVIRONMENT-ASSESSMENT.md F-2):

#
# A virtual environment was created OUTSIDE the repository and sat there unnoticed for
# sixteen days. Nothing in the repository knew it existed, because nothing could: the only
# authority on where the repository is was the thing that had just got it wrong.
#
# git rev-parse --show-toplevel asks the repository where it is, which cannot be wrong in
# the way file layout can. The BASH_SOURCE derivation is retained as a fallback for the case
# git genuinely cannot answer (git absent, or a source export with no .git), and the
# fallback is guarded so an unset BASH_SOURCE resolves through $PWD instead of through "".

#
# Metadata alone is NOT sufficient, and the difference is not theoretical. A pinned
# tool can be RECORDED at the correct version while its executable is absent: an
# interrupted or partially completed reinstall leaves the import package, the
# version and the dist-info intact but never writes bin/<tool>. A metadata-only
# check then reports "already present and at expected versions", ucos_install_deps
# is never invoked, and the tool fails at the point of use instead of at the point
# of verification — which is the opposite of a self-healing environment. Measured
# consequence: bin/ruff was absent while `metadata.version("ruff")` returned the
# pinned 0.8.4, so this function reported a healthy toolchain, no repair was
# attempted, and verify.sh Stage 1 failed with FileNotFoundError on every run. That
# in turn failed the fixed-point gate's CK-VERIFY and STAGE-VERIFY, and the
# resulting certifier residue closed G-15 over an otherwise convergent repository.
#
# The executable set is DERIVED from each distribution's own manifest, never listed
# here, so it needs no edit when a pin is added or changed, and it covers wheel data
# scripts that declare no console_scripts entry point. That last case is exactly the
# ruff case: ruff ships its binary as a wheel script with an EMPTY console_scripts
# group, so an entry-points-based check would miss the only executable that mattered.

# --- Canonical ruff quality gate (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH) ------------------------
# The lint + format-check gate that every fast verification path must run identically:
#   * verify.sh   Stage 1 (the canonical gate)
#   * the pre-commit hook installed by scripts/install-hooks.sh
# Defining it here — the file both already source — guarantees the two paths can never
# drift (the RC-1 gate-reconciliation invariant: "verify.sh passes => pre-commit passes").
# Runs the pinned ruff via the venv interpreter by ABSOLUTE PATH (no activation, no PATH
# dependency). ruff format --check is a NON-mutating check (it never rewrites files); use
# `make format` to apply formatting.
ucos_ruff_gate() {
  # UCOS-GOV-LINT-BOUNDARY: lint scope is the git-tracked file set, not the filesystem.
  #
  # WHY: ruff receives directory arguments and walks all .py files it finds — including
  # untracked files (macOS Finder " 2" copies, ephemeral editors, generated transients).
  # An untracked file with a lint error blocks every legitimate commit regardless of
  # whether that file will ever be committed. The pre-commit hook exists to validate
  # *the intended mutation* (staged + tracked content), not arbitrary filesystem state.
  #
  # HOW: git ls-files returns only tracked paths. We filter to Python files under the
  # governed source roots (engine/ platform/) and pass them explicitly.  This preserves
  # the RC-1 invariant ("verify.sh passes ⇒ pre-commit passes") because verify.sh also
  # calls this function — both paths now operate on the identical tracked boundary.
  #
  # GOVERNANCE VISIBILITY: untracked files are NOT hidden from governance. RIB GATE-12
  # (dirty_entries_outside_generated) and VAL-02 still surface them as working-tree
  # contamination — they are classified, not silently ignored.
  #
  # IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: if no tracked Python files exist in engine/ or platform/ the
  # gate becomes a no-op and exits 0, which is correct (nothing to lint).
  #
  # UCOS-CL-011 — the plumbing is NUL-delimited end to end. The first implementation
  # joined paths with newlines and piped them to a bare `xargs`, which splits on ANY
  # whitespace: a tracked path containing a space would have been passed to ruff as two
  # nonexistent paths. 23 tracked paths contain spaces today; none is currently a .py, so
  # the defect was latent rather than active — but a gate whose correctness depends on
  # that coincidence is not a gate. It also passed `git ls-files` output straight through,
  # which lists INDEX entries: a tracked file deleted in the working tree but not yet
  # staged was handed to ruff, which fails on a missing path and would have blocked every
  # commit during an ordinary staged deletion. And it prefixed paths with
  # `sed "s|^|$repo/|"`, which corrupts any repository path containing `|`.
  #
  # All three are removed: `-z` from git, `-0` into xargs, an existence filter for the

# --- UEG-000001 · the environment integrity gate (OBSERVE ONLY) ------------------
# THE VERIFICATION HALF OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. ucos_ensure_venv above is the REPAIR
# half: it deletes, creates and installs, and bootstrap.sh (plus `doctor.sh --fix`) are the
# only things allowed to call it. This function is what a verification path calls instead.
# It observes and refuses. It creates nothing, installs nothing, and reaches no network.
#
# Why the distinction is load-bearing rather than stylistic (assessment finding F-1):
# ./verify.sh used to call ucos_ensure_venv, so a run that was supposed to DETECT toolchain
# drift would instead `rm -rf` the drifted venv, rebuild it and report green — the drift
# detected was the drift erased, and the evidence went with it. It also made the canonical
# gate depend on network reachability, so an offline machine got an infrastructure failure
# reported as a verification failure.
#
# TWO LAYERS, AND THE ORDER MATTERS. The real gate is a Python module, and a Python module
# cannot report that Python is missing. So this function checks in shell exactly the one
# condition that would prevent the gate from running at all — a venv interpreter that is
# absent or not executable — and hands everything else to the module, which can actually

# --- Working-tree lease (AEOS G-04) ----------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Multiple agent sessions write to this tree with no lock, and it has
# corrupted a certification measurement at least twice: final_certification_report.md §14
# records a second process that "advanced HEAD twice, and committed my uncommitted edits
# into its own commit while deleting untracked files I had created", and a later
# integration run failed test_verification_purity because three tracked files moved
# under it twenty-two minutes before the run began. Neither was a defect in the
# verification plane. Both were the absence of this.
#
# WHAT A LEASE BUYS THAT A LOCK DOES NOT. Mutual exclusion is the smaller half. The
# larger half is ATTRIBUTABILITY: a measurement taken while another process mutates the
# tree is attributable to no commit, so the lease records HEAD and the porcelain digest
# at acquisition and ucos_lease_verify re-measures them at release. A run whose subject
# moved underneath it must say so rather than report a verdict about a state that never
# existed as a whole.
#
# IT REFUSES; IT DOES NOT KILL. A live holder is reported with its pid and age and the
# run stops. Reaping another process is not a verification command's business, and a
# lease that kills is a lease that loses work.
#
# STALE LEASES ARE RECLAIMED, NOT OBEYED. A lease whose pid is gone is an artifact of a
