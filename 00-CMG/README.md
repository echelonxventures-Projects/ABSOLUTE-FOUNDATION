This zone holds the **meta-constitutional layer** of UCOS Ω∞: the law that defines what a Constitution *is*, which artifacts *are* constitutions, and how constitutional authority is allocated and ranked across the whole corpus.

It governs **recognition**, never **substance** and never **process**. Substance belongs to each domain constitution; process belongs supremely to the Constitutional Engineering Program. The meta layer's only operations on other instruments are **recognize, record, rank, and refer**.

## Running the gate

```
make cmg-gate                              # or
./00-CMG/tools/cmg-gate.sh                 # or
python3 00-CMG/tools/cmg_validate.py [--emit path/to/evidence.json]
```

Exit status: `0` zero findings · `1` findings · `2` fail-closed abort.
Standard library only; no network, no third-party package, byte-identical output across runs.

Current result: **0 findings**, readiness **`READY-PROVISIONAL`**.

## Where to start

- **To understand the design:** CMG-000001 Articles VI, VII (why a meta layer at all), XVI (the precedence lattice), and LXXXII (the delegation register — the whole Zero-Parallel-Authority mechanism in one table).
- **To understand what is unfinished:** CMG-000014. Two questions dominate everything else.
- **To understand what this changes in the repository:** CMG-000002. The answer is: one new zone, eight appended `Makefile` lines, and the derived registry/portal regeneration that the repository's own registration hook performed automatically — with zero existing identifiers renumbered and zero existing content hashes changed.

## The one thing to know

CMG-000001 is **PROVISIONAL, not ratified**, and says so. Tier T1 — the substantive constitutional authority that the located charter already presupposes — is **vacant**, and the corpus contains no authority competent to ratify anything. Both facts pre-date this zone; CMG-000001 is simply the first instrument to record them, and the validator enforces the resulting `READY-PROVISIONAL` ceiling so that provisional standing cannot quietly be read as final.
