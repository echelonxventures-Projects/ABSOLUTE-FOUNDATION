# UCOS Ω∞ — Canonical developer entry points.
#
# Every target delegates to the self-bootstrapping shell entry points so there is a
# single source of truth for environment behavior. None of these require a manually
# activated virtualenv.
#
#   make bootstrap     create/repair the canonical venv + pinned toolchain, validate it
#   make doctor        report + validate the environment (Python/pytest/pytest-cov/coverage/ruff)
#   make verify        THE canonical gate: lint + tests/coverage + governance enforcement
#   make verify-full   verify + full registration/drift gate (register.sh --guard)
#   make lint          ruff only
#   make test          pytest + coverage gate only
#   make clean-venv    remove the disposable .ec1-venv (recreated on next bootstrap/verify)
