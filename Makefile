# Four operational-memory programme phases are terminal historical determinations: their
# missions completed and their responsibility is held by their successor programmes. They
# are retained as constitutional evidence, and this guard proves each archived phase
# directory and its completion determination is still present.
#
# THEIR ENGINES ARE PIPELINE STAGES, not frozen artifacts. This comment previously stated
# that no regeneration target names them and that their one-shot engines are
# wall-clock-stamped and would dirty the tree. UCOS-RFP-001 producer discovery measured
# both claims and both were false: the engines are DETERMINISTIC over two runs at one
# commit, and their committed registers had drifted from what they re-derive. Under
# CLS-OPERATIONAL-MEMORY the convergence obligation is REQUIRED — a determination that
# re-execution does not reproduce evidences nothing — so they are declared stages of the
# fixed-point pipeline and re-derived like every other producer. Being historical is not
# an exemption from being reproducible.

# uaie: UAIE-000001 — the architectural intelligence faculty binding and register-plane
# reasoning register.
#
# WHY THIS BLOCK EXISTS. The mission this programme records names ten architectural faculties
# — semantic graph, architectural reasoning, dependency, ownership, duplication, gap, evolution,
# reuse, constitutional and completion intelligence — and twelve subjects the repository must be
# able to reason about. EVERY ONE of them already had a canonical owner and a located register
# before this programme existed, so nothing here is built: each faculty is bound by pointer to
# the owner that realises it, to the analysis already registered in 00-MASTER/UCOS-UAR-001, and
# to the registers it reasons over, and the binding is then MEASURED so a rename, a move or a
# deletion closes the gate instead of silently invalidating the claim.
#
# WHAT IS ADDED. Exactly three analyses, and they are entries in the LOCATED analysis registry
# rather than a registry of this programme's own: cross-register consistency, faculty binding
# resolution, and closure over the faculty relation. The first is the one measurement no located
# owner performed — each owner validates its own register, and none reads one register's
# references against what the repository still holds, so a register that drifts while its own
# owner stays green is visible only across them.
#
# WHAT IS NOT ADDED. No engine, no registry, no catalogue, no identity, no graph, no lifecycle,
# no authority and no namespace. The programme is classified SUBSTANTIVE under

# UCOS-AEE-001 — AUTONOMOUS EVOLUTION ENGINE.
#
# The closed loop. Every phase of the evolution loop already has a located, certified
# owner in this repository, and this programme creates none of them — no validator, no
# gate, no registry, no schema, no measurement, no certification. What no located
# programme owned is the LOOP: every entry point here is a one-shot process, so nothing
# re-executed the located owners, re-read their sealed determinations, compared
# consecutive readings and asserted a fixed point over what they report.
#
# The loop's phases are not restated anywhere in this programme. They are READ at run
# time from the declarations that already own them — the pipeline catalogue's evolution
# and implementation pipelines, and the evolution-intelligence loop and its standing
# continuous obligations. A phase appended to any of those sources is discovered on the
# next run; a phase nothing discharges is reported as uncovered rather than assumed.
#
# Convergence here is over the OBSERVATION VECTOR — the tuple of every located owner's
# reported verdict — and requires consecutive iterations to agree. Byte-level repository
# closure is a different and stronger condition owned by UCOS-RFP-001 and measured by
# `make rfp-gate`; this programme never invokes it, which is what keeps the driver out of
# the fixed-point engine's own pipeline (RFP CYC-RECURSE).
#
# Adding an actuator, an observation, a classification rule, a decision value, a

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE CONVERGENCE — four programmes, one ordered chain.
#
# WHY THIS BLOCK EXISTS. The aggregate certifier reported two standing ceilings, and neither was
# a missing capability: both were missing MACHINERY.
#
#   * The authority ceiling. Every authority in this repository existed only as prose — a table
#     in a located register, or ARTICLE I of a located instrument. The tier lattice alone was
#     machine-readable. So no gate could resolve which authority was competent for an act, no
#     gate could detect an authority referenced but defined nowhere, and no gate could detect
#     that a recorded claim of authority ABSENCE had been contradicted by later located evidence.
#     Separately, CEP-006 Article XVI mandates a Ratification Registry and XVI.4 deems any
#     ratification absent from it NON-EXISTENT — and no registry existed, so five located and
#     committed ratification acts could not lawfully be relied upon by anything.
#
#   * The traceability ceiling. Two different obligations had been conflated under one word. The
#     CONSTITUTIONAL obligation (CEP-001 XVIII.1 upward rooting and downward evidence, XVIII.2
#     and CEP-008 XI.2 closure with zero orphans) is the one CEP-006 V.1 and CEP-007 V.1 both
#     name, verbatim, as the ratification and freeze precondition. The thirteen-lane ENGINEERING
#     spine is a richer model owned by platform/measurement and 00-BOOK/tools. Only the first is
#     a constitutional precondition, and nothing measured it on its own terms.
#
# AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH) for all four. Stdlib only. Each writes nothing outside its own
# operational-memory directory, proven by a fail-closed write-scope guard. None creates an
# authority, confers a ratification, populates a traceability lane, weakens a predicate or
# performs a freeze. Every identifier each one acts on is read from a located instrument or from
# its own declaration, and a zero-enumeration guard fails closed if any leaks into engine source.
#
# NOTHING HERE LIFTS THE FINALITY CEILING. CEP-006 I.4 caps every in-corpus determination at
# provisional acceptance pending an out-of-corpus finality authority. That ceiling is preserved,
# and UCCEP-F-004 is deliberately RETAINED as blocking so the aggregate verdict stays capped.
# What changed is that the ceiling is now the ONLY one standing, and CEP-007 III.2 admits an
# artifact to the freeze lifecycle at provisional acceptance — which the located foundation
# freeze authorization records in terms as "not a freeze blocker".
#
# Additive only — no existing target, recipe or dependency above is altered.

# It projects every constitutionally accepted concept already in Repository Truth into a
# governed Repository Requirement and MEASURES assimilation coverage, lifecycle maturity,
# readiness, traceability and gap. CREATE = 0 at the concept layer: requirement identity is
# a derived, injective function of the existing concept identity (RR-<CONCEPT-ID>).
#
# Why these targets exist. UCOS-RIB-001 measured this programme as BOTH a dead engine
# (VER-11 / GAP-DEAD-ENGINE) and an orphan capability (VER-09): its engine was named by no
# Makefile target, no workflow and no test, so REG-AUTO-001 P7 — enforceability by tooling
# gates rather than author discipline — was undischarged. The consequence was not cosmetic:
# because nothing re-ran it, its committed registers were left rendered against a stale
# HEAD and carried 89 inherited concept gaps that Repository Truth had already closed. An
# engine no target names is an engine nobody re-runs, and a register nobody re-runs is a
# register that silently stops being true.
#
# closure009 depends on closure-phase3 because the engine's required inputs are the
# PHASE-002/003 models; running it against an unregenerated predecessor would measure a
# superseded substrate (the engine itself fails closed with exit 2 if they are absent).

# as a string in a declaration discharges nothing.

# look present while being absent: the declaration rehydrates; every declared position of
# the loop resolves to an owner that exists, binds its symbols and names a wired gate;
# every canonical stage of the perpetual cycle is claimed by exactly one position; every
# dependency resolves and runs forward; conducting the same candidates twice produces
# byte-identical runs; the declared UNKNOWN subject — an object in no registry, of no
# declared class, owned by nobody — traverses every position to a settled, certified run
# without a new registry, authority, engine or schema; every declared mandatory invariant
# is measured against its expectation rather than presumed satisfied; every declared
# register renders bytes that reproduce on another process and another machine; the
# repository's own verification entry point invokes this gate fail-closed; and every
# declared exit criterion of every implementation phase is measured rather than asserted.
#
# The count is deliberately not written here. It grows as more of the declaration becomes
# measurable, and `make uaue` prints the whole set with its detail — a number in a comment
# is a claim that goes stale silently, which is the defect class this register exists to
# close.

# THE DEFECT, MEASURED. In an isolated worktree at HEAD, seven workflow files were deleted —

#
# THE ROOT CAUSE, and why it is not carelessness. The repository has exactly ONE closure
# mechanism over its objects: REG-AUTO-001 registration. Its boundary, in 00-BOOK/tools/config.py,

#
# UEC-000001 measures how many enforcement artifacts are reachable from exactly ONE invocation

# gate stops running while every report stays green. Two of the fourteen it counted were

# ten universal object invariants over the whole version-controlled boundary, and
# `engine/root_ontology/gate.py`, which measures the constitutional primitive alignment. Both
# are blocking stages of the canonical gate, and neither could be run by name.
#
# These targets are the second plane. They add no authority, no new gate and no second criteria
# set: each invokes the identical command ./verify.sh already invokes, so the two planes cannot
# disagree about what the gate is. After adopting them the measured population falls to twelve
# and the declared ceiling is tightened to match — UEC-L-11 refuses a ceiling left above its

# UCI-000001 — Universal Certification Integrity.
#
# WHAT THIS PROGRAMME MEASURES, AND WHY IT DID NOT EXIST BEFORE.
#
# Every coverage gate in this repository governed a NUMERATOR. The denominator was
# declared twice (`addopts` and `[tool.coverage.run] source`), reconciled by
# UCOS-COV-SCOPE-001 against each other, and compared to the executable surface by
# nothing at all. Measured at b51f6f84: the denominator held 905 of 1,524 tracked
# non-test Python files, so a reported 97.9% was a true statement about 52% of the
# executable surface, and executable-surface coverage was 44.9%.
#
# Outside the denominator: all 39 00-MASTER/*/*_engine.py gate engines (20,359
# statements, every one an enforcement artifact UEC-000001 governs by name),
# 00-BOOK/tools including ukb.py (the registration enforcement the whole corpus
# plane depends on), intelligence/ (in pytest testpaths, in no --cov flag), and
# engine/recursive_knowledge (an implicit namespace package the scope control could
# not see because it enumerated by __init__.py).
#
# These targets are one of the two invocation planes UEC-L-06 requires; the other

#
# WHAT THIS PROGRAMME REPLACED. Every governance control in this repository used to
# quantify over a list somebody wrote. The lists were correct when written and

# than by any control firing: SOURCE_TREES = ("engine", "platform") while five other
# roots existed; engine/recursive_knowledge invisible to an __init__.py predicate;
# 3,995 passing tests in four layers that no testpaths entry collected; scripts/ in
# no list at all. One root cause — a list has no term for what it omits, so it cannot
# report its own incompleteness.
#
# The five phases, each measured on every run of `make omega`:
#   Ω-1  scope, test roots and the coverage denominator DERIVED from git ls-files
#   Ω-2  authority derived by a chain whose last rule is unconditional (NONE is unreachable)
#   Ω-3  reachability over the execution graph, proved location-independent by experiment
