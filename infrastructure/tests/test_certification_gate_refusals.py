"""The CCE ten gates, shown REFUSING — across every Band-13 certification module at once.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS ONE FILE. Eleven infrastructure units each publish a
``cce_gates()`` suite of ten blocking criteria, and every existing suite certifies a
construct that satisfies all ten. So the ``_passed`` arm of every gate was measured and the
``_failed`` arm of none of them was: ten gates observed only agreeing with their subject,
in eleven modules, is eleven copies of a control nobody has ever seen fire.

The argument is identical in all eleven, so it is authored ONCE (UCKP-ART-03) and the
modules are DISCOVERED rather than listed (UCKP-ART-08): a twelfth certification module
added to ``infrastructure/`` is held to this the moment it exists, with no edit here.

WHAT A REFUSING SUBJECT IS. ``CertificationSubject`` is a pure projection of a validation
outcome, so a refusal is produced by handing the gates a projection of a validation that
FAILED — never by reaching into a gate. Two are needed, because ``_checks_ok``
distinguishes a check that did not run from one that ran and failed, and a suite that only
ever produced one of those would leave the other arm unexecuted.
