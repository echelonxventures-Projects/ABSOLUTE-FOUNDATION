#   ./verify.sh              DEFAULT = --change (commit validation)
#   ./verify.sh --fast       developer feedback: lint + impact-selected tests
#   ./verify.sh --change     commit validation: impact-selected tests + every governance gate

#   ./verify.sh --explain    print the plan and exit, executing nothing
#
# THE DEFAULT CHANGED, AND SAYING SO IS THE POINT. It was the full certification
# contract; it is now --change. That is not a weakening by stealth, because certification
# did not become weaker — it became EXPLICIT: .github/workflows/ec1-ci.yml invokes
# `./verify.sh --full` by name, and --full runs every stage the old default ran, under the
# same 90% floor, over the same whole suite. What changed is that the command a developer
# types dozens of times a day no longer costs a release certification. A 47-minute default
# is a default people route around, and a gate that is routed around is not a gate.
#
# MODES ARE NOT DECLARED HERE. 00-MASTER/UVI-000001/uvi-declaration.json holds the
# Verification Mode Constitution — what each mode claims, what it explicitly does not
# claim, which stages it admits, whether it may reuse evidence — and the Stage Registry
# that classifies every stage below by phase, plane and dependency. This script parses its
# own flags (a shell must, before it can run anything) and UVI-L-01 measures that the flags
# it accepts and the modes the constitution declares are the same set, in both directions.
#
# WHAT SELECTS THE TESTS. --fast and --change ask engine.verification_intelligence, which
# composes five substrates the repository already publishes — object identity, ownership,
# the dependency graph, the capability catalogue and the relationship graph — and FAILS
# WIDE: any change it cannot bound (a declaration, registry, schema, config, document,
# unregistered file, or a change to the selector itself) escalates to the whole suite WITH
# coverage. A selected run is only ever a subset when the subset is provably sufficient.
# Nothing anywhere names a test file; UVI-L-06 measures that.
#
# WHAT IS NOT NEGOTIABLE. Every gate below still exists, is still owned by the same
# instrument and is still evaluated by the same command. UVI-L-04 holds the pre-existing
# contract as a ratchet: every stage the certification default ran before this rework must
# still be a declared stage AND still admitted by every certification-eligible mode.
# UVI-L-05 refuses any mode that claims more than it measures, and UVI-L-08 measures that
# sharding and concurrency change no obligation — the shards union to exactly the
# selection, and the coverage floor is evaluated once, by the coverage tool, over combined
# data.
#
# THE one repository-standard command. A brand-new terminal can run this with NO
# manual `source .../activate` and NO tribal knowledge: Stage 0 verifies the canonical
# environment (UEG-000001) and every gate then runs through the venv interpreter by
# absolute path. Exits non-zero on any failure.
#
# IT VERIFIES THE ENVIRONMENT; IT DOES NOT REPAIR IT. This script used to self-heal the venv
# and that capability moved to ./bootstrap.sh, because a command that repairs its own subject
# cannot report on it — see the Stage 0 comment for the measured reason. A refusal here names
# what was expected, what was detected, and the one command that fixes it.

# --- Stage 0: UEG-000001 environment integrity gate (OBSERVE ONLY) ---------------
# THIS SCRIPT NO LONGER REPAIRS ITS OWN ENVIRONMENT, AND SAYING SO IS THE POINT.
#
# It used to call ucos_ensure_venv here, which will `rm -rf` a virtual environment whose
# Python series drifted, rebuild it, and `pip install -e ".[dev]"` — over the network. That
# is a fine thing for a setup command to do and a disqualifying thing for a verification
# command to do: the run that was supposed to DETECT drift instead erased it and reported
# green, and the canonical gate acquired a dependency on an index being reachable, so an
# offline machine got an infrastructure failure reported as a verification failure.
#
# The repair capability did not disappear; it moved to the entry point that owns it.
# ./bootstrap.sh creates and installs, ./doctor.sh --fix repairs on explicit request, and
# this path observes and refuses. UEG-000001 declares that boundary
# (00-MASTER/UEG-000001/ueg-declaration.json, separation_of_powers) and
# engine/tests/unit/test_execution_environment.py measures it over the source of THIS FILE,
# so re-adding an install here fails the suite rather than passing unnoticed.
#
# WHAT THE GATE ACTUALLY CHECKS — eight declared conditions, seven of them blocking: that
# the running interpreter belongs to THIS repository (a root misresolution once built a venv
# in the parent directory and nothing noticed for sixteen days), that sys.prefix IS the
# canonical venv rather than merely near it, that the series matches the one CI pins, that
# pytest resolves inside this environment, that pytest_cov / coverage / jsonschema actually
# IMPORT rather than merely record a version, that every pin is installed with every
# executable its own RECORD declares, and that the configuration it measured against parsed
# to a non-empty expectation. The eighth reports global shadowing and undeclared
# executables without blocking.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT A run_stage. A run_stage executes THROUGH $PY, and this gate's entire job is
# to decide whether $PY may be trusted at all — it must precede the stage machinery, not sit
# inside it. It also precedes planning, so a faulted plan cannot be caused by a broken
# interpreter and then misread as an intelligence fault. Keeping it out of run_stage
# additionally leaves the fourteen stage literals below untouched, and those literals are a
# three-reader contract: this script executes them, UAKOS-CLOSURE-008/validation-record.json
# digests them, and .github/workflows/uisd-gate.yml re-derives them.
#
# COST: measured at 0.17s cold and 0.13s warm on the assessed machine, against a declared
# budget of 5s. It writes only .ucos/ (gitignored) and reaches no network.

# exist, and 51 tests that pass here failed in CI — measured on a fresh clone of HEAD:
# 50 failed + 3 errors, reduced to 2 by running exactly these five producers.
#
# This stage MUST precede the pytest stage: a prerequisite generated after the gate that
# consumes it is not a prerequisite. Every write lands on an ignored path, so the stage
# cannot dirty the working tree and cannot be seen as drift by the Registration Gate.

#
# THE ARGV IS NOT CHOSEN HERE ANY MORE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. It used to be assembled
# by this block: a mode test, a call to the impact engine, a shell word-split of its
# stdout into a pytest command line. Selection, escalation, coverage policy and process
# topology were four decisions taken in bash, one of them by splitting a string on
# whitespace. They are now one decision, taken once, in Stage 0b, by an engine that is
# itself tested and measured under the coverage floor — and `run-tests` executes exactly
# the plan `--explain` printed, which is what makes the plan honest rather than a
# description of something else.
#
# What that engine does with this stage, per the constitution: --integration and --full
# run the whole suite under the floor and are the only certification-eligible paths;
# --fast and --change run the selection with --no-cov so they cannot become a second
# owner of the floor; and any selection that ESCALATES runs the whole suite WITH the
# floor, exactly as the certification path would have run it. Under every mode the
# selection is partitioned into shards that run concurrently, and under the floor their
# coverage data is combined so the floor is evaluated once, over the union, by the
# coverage tool itself.
#
# The STAGE LABEL is not mode-dependent and must not become so. There is exactly one
# `run_stage "pytest + coverage gate (--cov-fail-under=90)"` line in this file, because
# platform/tests/test_canonical_validation_evidence.py derives the verification contract

#   Ω-2  an artifact resolving to authority = NONE without a transient declaration
#   Ω-3  a relocation that changes a governance verdict — proved by moving the largest

#   Ω-4  a metric worse than this repository's own best with no written justification

# this stage IS that invocation. It adds no second pipeline, scheduler, or daemon
# (LXVI.7) and no second criteria set (L.2): the criteria are CMG-INV-01..12 and
# nothing else, evaluated by the validator Article L.3 names as its realization.
#
# Before this stage existed, meta-constitutional conformance was measurable but only
# on demand, so a corpus could drift into parallel authority, orphan governance, a
# dangling superior or an illegal lifecycle record and stay green through every gate.
# XLIX.7 is explicit that an unchecked obligation is of UNKNOWN compliance and SHALL
# NOT be presumed satisfied; binding the gate here converts the twelve invariants from
# on-demand measurement into continuous enforcement.
#
# Read-only and fail-closed (L.4): the validator writes nothing and reports a finding
# rather than a pass on any unparseable, missing or ambiguous input. It is deterministic
# and hermetic (L.5), so it cannot flake a verification run.

# The gates above enforce the DOCUMENT corpus. config.INCLUDE_EXTENSIONS is

# EXECUTES: at the time this stage was added, 4510 version-controlled objects —
# every engine, every test, every workflow, and all 29 producers named by the
# generated-artifact registry — carried no universal identity, no owner and no
# lifecycle. The corpus governed 1233 artifacts by naming producers that were
# themselves anonymous.
#
# This stage closes that leg. It asserts the ten universal invariants over the
# WHOLE version-controlled boundary, so a new engine, test or config file can no
# longer enter the repository unidentified, unowned, unregistered or unaudited.
#
# Read-only and fail-closed: `gate` mints nothing and writes nothing (`run` does
# that), and it reports a violation rather than a pass on any input it cannot
# measure. Deterministic and hermetic — no clock, no network — so it cannot flake.
#
# All ten invariants block. UGA-INV-06 (bootstrap path for every generated input)
# was briefly carried as a non-blocking DECLARED-OPEN condition while `realization/`
# had a declared producer but no bootstrap invocation. That gap is now discharged:
# the producer was made deterministic — its manifest sealed a per-run `action`, so it
# had no fixed point — and added to scripts/generate-prerequisites.sh. The registry's
# `bootstrap_gaps` is empty and the exemption is gone with the condition it covered.

#
# WHAT WAS MEASURED BEFORE IT EXISTED, at fce3cb9b: `.claude/` held zero tracked files,
# `.cursor/` did not exist, all seven `.kiro/` hooks were frozen, and no CLAUDE.md,
# steering file or rules directory existed anywhere in the tree. No agent surface
# claimed authority — and none received any context either. `agents` was the single
# knowledge domain of twelve with NO declared authority.
#
# An ownerless context domain is not a safe steady state. It is the state in which the
# first hand-written agent instruction file becomes repository truth — on one branch,
# under no authority, listed in no register — and every later agent inherits it. Under
# UCKP-ART-03 that file is void the moment it restates a rule the constitution already
# holds, but "void" is a property nothing was measuring.
#
# This stage measures it. Every agent surface is now a GENERATED projection of
# 00-BOOK/DATA/context-authority.json, so a hand edit is drift (INV-CTX-07) rather than
# a new rule, and a branch or worktree carrying context the declaration does not produce
# is a refusal (INV-CTX-08 / INV-CTX-09) rather than a divergence nobody noticed.
#
# Read-only and fail-closed. The gate is a SEPARATE module from the generator on
# purpose: it reads `git status --porcelain` and the ref list, and a producer that reads
# the working tree is an undeclared observer under UGA OBS-INV-12. The generator writes

#
# --check writes nothing. It re-derives the certificate and refuses if what is on disk

# duplication, overlap, verification — so a draft can never reach the authority without
# passing them in order.
#
# WHY IT PASSES WHILE THE LANE IS UNDECLARED. `proposal_lane` is not yet in
# context-authority.json, so there are no proposals and nothing is in a bad state. A stage
# that refused here would be failing the build for a subsystem the repository has
# deliberately not adopted yet. The bare CLI still reports the undeclared lane as a refusal,
# because a human asking "can you assimilate?" deserves the honest no; only --gate, whose
# question is "is any proposal wrong?", treats an empty lane as clean.

# --- Stage 6b-prov: independent context verification (UCOS-UCTX-001, MB7) -------
# The stage above is computed BY the generator's own derivation, so it cannot detect a
# generator that is uniformly wrong. Measured: ten variants — an injected sentence, a
# reversed rule, a fabricated authority, a permuted table, a swapped authority home, a
# truncated statement, a deleted section, a dropped article — each left all fifteen
# invariants green, because all fifteen are computed from the run that produced the error.
#
# That is MB7, and it is not specific to this capability: the generated-artifact registry
# records validation_owner == owner for every entry, 13 of 33 producers have no validator
# outside their own home, and 18 of the 19 that do import or execute the producer they
# validate. Module separation is not authority separation.
#
# This stage is the independent leg. It does not import ukctx, run it, or read its source.
# It asks three questions of the emitted surfaces: does every LINE trace to a declared
# source (a reviewed template, or a string a declared authority already holds); is every
# declared RECORD projected whole rather than re-paired; is every declared OBLIGATION
# carried rather than quietly dropped. Five of the ten variants emit no undeclared text at
# all, which is why one question would not have been enough.
#
# It found two live defects on its first run, both of which the fifteen invariants had
# reported as closure: UCKP-ART-01 (Supremacy) absent from every agent surface, and all
# nineteen remaining article statements truncated at their final line.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM. It does not prove the manifest's first population was right —
# that was reviewed in the commit that introduced it. It guarantees that nothing is added
# afterwards without the same review, which moves the attack from "edit one script" to
# "edit a script AND an authored instrument".

# --- Stage 6b-ufi: independent verification, every declared adopter (MB7 rollup) --
# The stage above closes MB7 for ONE capability. Measured across the repository, that is
# where the defect lives generally: `validation_owner` equals `owner` for every entry of
# the generated-artifact registry, NO producer has a test inside its own home, and 16 of
# 33 producers have no producer-specific validator anywhere. A verifier written 33 times
# would be 33 new things that can each be uniformly wrong, so the checks were extracted
# into one implementation (00-BOOK/tools/ufi.py) that a producer ADOPTS by declaring its
# own authorities and its own manifest.
#
# The framework shares CODE and never AUTHORITY: ufi.py holds no list of any adopter's
# authorities, surfaces or templates, and a shared authority source would be the rival
# authority UCKP-ART-03 voids.
#
# This stage carries no count and names no adopter. Adoption is adding a declaration to
# 00-BOOK/DATA/independence/, and a stage that had to be edited to admit its next adopter
# would make adoption a documentation change in three files. It fails closed on an empty
# adopter set, because a framework that passes by verifying nothing is the defect again.
#
# UCOS-UCTX-001 is deliberately verified here AND by the stage above. That is not
# redundancy to remove: it is the second invocation plane UEC-L-06 asks for, so deleting
# either leg still leaves the check running.

# --- Stage 6c: autonomous universal evolution gate (UAUE-000001) ------------------
# The evolution declaration binds three of its eleven positions — Execute, Validate and
# Verify — to `./verify.sh` as their gate, and its Evolve position to `make uaue-gate`.
# Until this stage existed, that binding was a claim about a pipeline that had never heard
# of UAUE: the gate was fail-closed, deterministic and green, and it was only ever invoked
# by hand. AUE-VER-04 (governance integrity) requires that every gate a position names be
# wired into the repository's verification, and an obligation nothing evaluates is of
# UNKNOWN compliance rather than satisfied. This stage is that wiring.
#
# Every obligation is fail-closed, and the stage name deliberately carries no count: the set
# grows as more of the declaration becomes measurable, and a number in a label is a stale claim
# waiting to happen — this stage is named in the canonical validation record, so a count here
# would make every new obligation a documentation edit in three files. What the obligations are is
# the gate's own report: the declaration rehydrates; every position resolves to an owner that
# exists and binds the symbols it is read through; every canonical Article-14 stage is claimed by
# exactly one position; every dependency resolves and runs forward; conducting the same candidates
# twice produces byte-identical runs; the declared UNKNOWN subject traverses the whole loop to a
# settled, certified run requiring no new registry, authority, engine or schema; every declared
# mandatory invariant is measured against its expectation; every declared register renders bytes
# that reproduce on another process and another machine; every declared exit criterion of every
# implementation phase is measured; and — the obligation this stage is the other half of — this
# pipeline is measured to actually invoke the gate fail-closed, so deleting the stage below closes
# the gate instead of silently unbinding four positions.
#
# Read-only and hermetic. `--gate` conducts and measures; it renders nothing, mutates
# nothing outside memory, and reaches no clock and no network, so it cannot dirty the tree
# and cannot flake. Exit 1 means an obligation was refused; exit 2 means no verdict could
# be reached, which is deliberately not the same answer.

# declaration and the measured tree. This stage regenerates them in memory and compares
# the committed bytes, so a hand edit is a failure here rather than a fact anywhere.
#
# Byte comparison, not parsed comparison: a projection that only matches after
# normalisation is a projection whose canonical form nobody is holding to. The remedy for
# a drift report is never to edit the file — it is `make uaue-render`, which reproduces it
# from the declaration.

# which makes identity a measurement of location that changes when the location does.
# This gate measures the one thing none of them measures: that every object in the birth
# ledger was identified before it was instantiated, and that no identity was replaced.
#
# The eight laws are each computed, never asserted: UOBC-L-01 identity precedes existence
# (measured against the declaration's own identity_exists flags), L-02 derived never
# counted (the ledger must not hold `category_seq`, the declared mint marker, or it would
# be a second identity authority under CAA-INV-04's own test), L-03 identity immutability
# (every recorded id is RE-DERIVED from its namespace and local name — a tampered id
# fails without needing a history), L-04 no anonymous object, L-05 no temporary identity,
# L-06 no post-creation registration, L-07 evolution under one identity, L-08 append-only
# history.
#
# Read-only and hermetic: it loads the declaration and the ledger, computes, writes
# nothing, and reads no clock and no network, so it cannot dirty the tree and cannot
# flake. Exit 1 means a law was measured and refused; exit 2 means no verdict could be

# CERTIFICATION.md, 23 finite-assumption axes in 04-HIDDEN-FINITE-ASSUMPTION-
# CERTIFICATION.md — but that second document records in its own §4 that no exhaustive
# proof of absence was performed and confines the residual risk to the realization
# layers. A property asserted in a dated document decays; this stage computes it.
#
# What it does NOT assert, because the assertion would be false and the stage would get
# deleted rather than fixed: that no enumeration is closed anywhere. engine/uckp/facets.py
# closes 33 facets deliberately so that every vocabulary inside them stays open — closure
# of the QUESTION set is what keeps the ANSWER sets infinite. The refused condition is
# UNDISCLOSED closure: an enumeration closed while nothing states what closes it or how a
# member is admitted. Ten enumerations are disclosed; one is disclosed as unintentional
# and carries gap ISD-G-01, which is the honest answer rather than a silent pass.
#
# The eleven laws are each computed, never asserted: ISD-L-01 scope capacity, L-02 direction
# capacity (the edge schema's type must be pattern-bound, never enum-bound), L-03 the
# principle inherits its own lifecycle and holds a birth record, L-04 the lifecycle stage
# graph declares itself open AND its executable projection has not drifted, L-05 the
# evolution cycle has no terminal stage and wraps, L-06 a relationship vocabulary admits a
# new term IN MEMORY without mutating the original — openness performed, not claimed —

# --- Stage 6g: constitutional primitive alignment (UCPA-000001) -------------------
# The root ontology was correct and unenforced. BEING, EXISTENCE, RELATIONSHIP and
# TRANSFORMATION were adjudicated and RATIFIED (UCOS-RAT-001 RAT-01/02/03, recorded at
# 01-WORKING/SUPERSESSION-REGISTER.md SUP-01/02/07), and then lived only as markdown:
# ONT-02, ONT-03 and ONT-04 appeared in no .py and no .json file anywhere in the tree. No
# gate measured them, so the canonical register's own reduction obligation was asserted
# and never computed, and an edit reinstating the superseded 5-primitive chain — or
# re-promoting BEING to an addressable layer — would have passed ./verify.sh --full.
#
# Separately, the 33-facet model (engine/uckp/facets.py) and the root primitives were
# co-resident and unreconciled: no artifact related a facet to a primitive. This stage
# carries that mapping and measures it, which is what Phase 1 Scope A asked for.
#
# It legislates NOTHING. Every primitive it names must first be found in the register that
# owns it, and the facet side is IMPORTED rather than restated, so the mapping cannot
# silently drift from the model it maps — it can only fail. A thirty-fourth facet admitted
# without a reduction closes this gate, which is correct: facets.py states that a new facet
# is a constitutional amendment, and an amendment must not pass unnoticed.
#
# The eight laws are computed, never asserted: UCPA-L-01 every bound primitive is an
# element the canonical register already declares, by id AND by element name, L-02 standing
# is read out of the ratification record rather than assumed, L-03 the facet reduction is
# total and single-valued over the live enumeration in both directions, L-04 nothing
# reduces to the axiom — RAT-01 made executable, L-05 every classified projection resolves
# and every superseded one is named by a superseding instrument that names it back, L-06
# exactly one authority and it is the one 00-MASTER/URRC-000001 already binds, L-07 the
# primitive set admits a future member — openness performed in memory, never persisted —
# L-08 the programme reduces to a primitive it declares rather than exempting itself.

# The stage that measures the thing deciding what the other stages do. Every gate above
# answers "is the repository compliant"; this one answers "is the verification that just
# ran the verification it claimed to be". Before it existed, the selector could have
# narrowed a run, a mode could have claimed a floor it never evaluated, a shard plan could
# have dropped a test object, and every one of those would have shown up as a faster green
# run — the most dangerous possible failure mode for a verification selector, because its
# symptom is indistinguishable from success.
#
# The ten laws are computed, never asserted: UVI-L-01 the flags this script accepts and the
# modes the constitution declares are the same set in both directions, L-02 the bare
# invocation resolves to the one declared default, L-03 the stage labels below and the
# stage registry agree exactly and in order, L-04 the ratchet — every gate the certification
# default ran before this rework is still declared AND still admitted by every
# certification-eligible mode, L-05 no mode claims more than it measures (certification
# requires the whole suite, the floor, and no evidence reuse), L-06 selection is derived
# rather than authored, measured over the engine's evaluated string constants so that a
# docstring may discuss a test file and a code path may not name one, L-07 fail wide,
# performed rather than described — three synthetic unbounded changes are put through the
# selector and each must widen, L-08 topology neutrality, performed — the suite is
# partitioned at six worker counts and every partition must be exactly the suite, L-09 no
# certification-eligible mode can reach a reuse decision at all, L-10 planning twice over
# one state produces identical bytes and no plan carries a clock or a machine path.

# --- Stage 6i: universal construct foundation (UCON-000001) -----------------------
# The gate that closes the distance between what the constitution DECLARES about unknown,
# contradictory and future constructs and what the runtime actually DOES with one.
#
# The defect it closes, measured before it existed. A construct whose classifying kind was
# unregistered raised MetaTypeUnknownError (engine/kernel/errors.py) and left no record, so
# "we governed a refusal" and "we never saw it" were the same observable state. A
# contradiction was a three-string finding recomputed on each run with no identity and no
# lifecycle (engine/knowledge/intelligence.py::ConflictFinding). An unknown was a
# coercion-failure message. So the foundational principle — any presented construct can be
# represented, governed, traced, researched and disposed without constitutional redesign —
# was true of the declarations and false of the runtime, and nothing measured the gap.
#
# The sixteen laws are computed, and several PERFORM the property rather than inspect a
# description of it: UCON-L-01 every construct carries exactly one active disposition and
# the model refuses a forged construct that does not, L-02/L-03 the rule set is total and its
# catch-all is non-destructive — ESCALATE, never REJECT, because a REJECT catch-all would
# silently discard precisely the constructs the rules failed to anticipate while reporting a
# clean fully-covered run, L-04 operators are bound two-way to the declared rules, L-05
# nothing is silently ignored, checked by arithmetic (the population cannot exceed the
# presentations) and by requiring a REJECT to remain readable, L-06 unknowns, contradictions,
# research and discovery objects are governed objects and any construct is promotable to a
# research object, L-07 recursive discovery reaches a fixed point, L-08 openness performed —
# eleven categories this repository has never modelled are registered and the package's own
# source fingerprint must be unchanged, L-09 all nine declared extension points are performed
# in memory and nothing narrows, L-10 no disposition and no reality state is terminal and
# every state strong enough to certify can still fall to one that cannot, L-11 admission and
# reality are independent — the whole 8x8 cross-product is realised and both modules are
# parsed to confirm neither imports the other, L-12 a verifier that declares no assumptions
# or no limitations is refused, L-13/L-15 two ratchets that fail in BOTH directions, on an
# undeclared guarantee claim or a stale exemption and on an undisclosed closure in governed
# scope or a stale disclosure, L-14 every reality state binds to a UCOS-CEU-001 row CEU
# actually carries rather than copying it, L-16 determinism.
#
# It also carries the extensibility audit: 1,400+ closure mechanisms across the repository,
# each joined to its declared risk tier, owner, limitation and migration path. That inventory
# MEASURES and migrates nothing — the ratchet enforces disclosure inside engine/construct/
# and a non-rising population everywhere else, because a gate demanding zero closures today
# would have been closed on the day it was written and would then have been deleted.
#
# OBSERVE MODE. Reads the declaration, the repository's committed source and its own

# --- Stage 6j (MAIN): universal enforcement closure (UEC-000001) ------------------
# CLOSURE OVER THE ENFORCEMENT SURFACE ITSELF. Every stage above measures some subject.
# This one measures whether the STAGES, GATES, WORKFLOWS, ENGINES, DECLARATIONS and TESTS
# still exist, are still governed, are still invoked from two independent planes, and are
# still covered by a test.
#
# WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT ONLY IN CI. The condition it refuses was measured in an isolated
# worktree at HEAD: seven workflow files deleted — including ec1-ci.yml, the only CI invoker
# of this script — plus six fail-closed Makefile gate targets, and `uvi-gate` still exited 0,
# `uaue-gate` still exited 0, and the test suite produced a byte-identical result. UVI
# reconciles the CONTENTS of this file against the stage registry (UVI-L-03/L-04); nothing
# measured whether anything still ran it, or whether the other fifty gate targets and thirty
# workflows were still present. A CI-only gate would leave the local certification path blind
# to exactly the deletion that removes the CI gate.
#
# ROOT CAUSE it closes: the repository's one closure mechanism (REG-AUTO-001) admits
# .md/.txt/.docx/.json outside .github/ and 00-MASTER/, so 0 of its 1597 registered artifacts
# are .py or .yml. The enforcement surface is definitionally outside it. UEC is the
# complementary plane; UEC-L-10 measures that the two do not overlap.
#
# READ_ONLY. No writes at all, not even to gitignored paths: there is no --render and no
# --write, so the gate cannot drift from an artifact it emitted and cannot be satisfied by
# regenerating its own expectation. Exit 1 means a blocking law refused; exit 2 means no
# verdict could be reached (no git work tree, so the tracked-path boundary is unknown), which

# THE CAPABILITY THIS STAGE RUNS WAS BUILT AND NEVER INVOKED, AND SAYING SO IS THE POINT.
# A declaration, a sixteen-module engine, thirty-two laws, a 249-subject governed ledger and a
# passing suite all existed at once, and NOTHING RAN ANY OF IT: no Makefile target, no workflow,
# no stage here, and no row in UEC-000001's governed enforcement inventory. The files were
# untracked, so UEC's discovery — which quantifies over `git ls-files` — could not see them
# either. Every gate in this repository was green while thirty-two laws measured nothing, which
# is exactly the observable state UEC-L-04 exists to refuse: nothing enforces by existing.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES. That every identified unknown becomes a governed subject carrying identity,
# a context, a state, an owner and a governing authority; that residual is representable rather
# than silently dropped; that histories are append-only and nothing admitted can disappear; that
# the vocabulary lives in the declaration rather than in the code; that no state is terminal and
# a future domain is admissible by data alone; that discovery reaches a fixed point and never
# mutates constitutional truth; that no subject exists outside governance or outside context;
# that the pipeline cannot be bypassed; that no completeness claim is declared; and that two
# measurements of one state produce identical bytes.
#
# TWO OTHER PLANES INVOKE THE SAME GATE — `make urke-gate` and

# one of them leaves a signal instead of a silently smaller verification. Removing THIS line

# unbinding thirty-two laws the way it did before the stage existed.

# ever called them: a search for importers of `mutation_classification` returned exactly one
# file outside the module, its own test. Neither the classifier nor its register appeared in
# UEC-000001's governed inventory, so both could have been deleted with every gate green.
#
# WHAT THAT COST, MEASURED TWICE. R-09 was first declared with NO PREDICATE, so
# `validate_rule_coverage` refused and `classify()` returned ERROR for EVERY subject in the
# corpus — 28 committed tests failed against committed source. It was then implemented and
# still could not fire: its six criteria are R-08's five plus one, R-08 was evaluated first,
# and GOVERNED_ANALYSIS claimed 0 of 6751 tracked paths. Coverage was green through both.
#
# THREE LAWS, DELIBERATELY NOT COLLAPSED. MGB-L-01 coverage (a declared rule with no predicate,
# and a predicate no rule declares). MGB-L-02 reachability (a rule shadowed by an earlier one
# can never fire, and precedence must be a total order) — the side coverage cannot see.
# MGB-L-03 population (a reachable rule that claims nothing over the live corpus, unless the
# register names it with a reason). Any two of these pass while the third fails.
#
# UNRESOLVED IS REPORTED, NOT REFUSED. 3612 of 6755 tracked paths reach the fail-closed
# terminal, almost all for one reason: they declare no Authority. That is a governance question
# with an owner, not a defect this stage may decide — refusing on it would legislate a policy
# nobody has adopted. The count prints on every run so it cannot be quietly forgotten.

# TWO OTHER PLANES INVOKE THE SAME GATE — `make mutation-gate` and
