"""UCOS Ω∞ — Universal Realization Intelligence (URI) · URI-000001.

The subsystem that turns canonical knowledge into architecture, schemas, APIs, runtime,
deployment, tests and documentation — deterministically, governed, and traceably.

Four engines and seven generators, one pipeline::

    canonical knowledge store (UKDA)          the only input authority
        │  KnowledgeIntake      integrity-verified, sealed
        ▼
    1. PlanningEngine           targets × families → acyclic, waved plan
    2. CompositionEngine        steps → sealed units; conflicts + duplicates refused
    3. GenerationEngine         units → sealed artifacts (pure; no I/O)
    4. ImplementationEngine     artifacts → files (frozen-path guarded, idempotent)
        │
        ├─ RealizationGovernor  twelve fail-closed gates → GOVERNED | REJECTED
        ├─ TraceabilityEngine   closure verified in BOTH directions
        └─ evidence             consolidated, sealed bundle (TRACK-001)

Generators: Architecture · Schema · API · Runtime · Deployment · Test · Documentation.

Invariants honoured by construction:

* **Derive, never author.** Canonical knowledge is read-only here. Knowledge absent from
  the store is reported as a coverage gap, never invented (``UCKO-PRIN-0001``).
* **Compose, never duplicate.** Hashing composes :mod:`engine.knowledge.model`; the output
  sink composes :mod:`intelligence.rie.config`; the gate ladder composes UCIC-001.
* **Governance precedes materialization.** A rejected run writes nothing.
* **Deterministic.** No wall-clock, no environment reads, sorted collections everywhere:
  identical canonical knowledge ⇒ byte-identical artifacts (``UCKO-PRIN-0005``).
* **Additive.** Writes land only in the generated-artifact root and the evidence
  directory; ``engine/**``, ``platform/**`` and the frozen corpus are never touched
  (``UCKO-PRIN-0002`` / DP-03).
* **Traceable.** Every artifact records the generator, plan, step, unit, target, source
  canonical objects, and knowledge seal it was derived from.

Standard library only (``UCKO-PRIN-0003`` / TP-04, TP-05). Authority: NONE — derived truth.
