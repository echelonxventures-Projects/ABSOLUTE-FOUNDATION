"""URI-000001 — the Planning Engine.

Turns integrity-verified canonical knowledge into a **derived** realization plan: what
must be realized, in what order, and from which canonical objects. Nothing about the
plan is authored — targets come from knowledge universes, steps come from the cross
product of targets and the seven artifact families, and the ordering comes from the
declared family dependency graph plus the canonical knowledge dependency topology.

Guarantees:

* **Deterministic** — ids are content-derived, collections are sorted, no clock is read.
  The same canonical knowledge always yields the identical plan and the identical seal.
* **Acyclic** — the step graph is topologically sorted with a fail-closed cycle check
  (:class:`~intelligence.realization.errors.PlanningError`).
* **Waved** — steps are grouped into parallel-safe waves (longest-path level), so the
  plan is directly executable by a concurrent runner without further analysis.
* **Complete** — every realizable canonical object is claimed by at least one step;
  anything unclaimed is reported as an explicit ``coverage_gaps`` entry rather than
  silently dropped.
