"""Evidence readers — the only inputs the engine trusts.

Every fact the engine reports is read here from repository evidence that other
certified/authoritative producers already emit:

  * ``00-BOOK/DATA/*.json``   — ukb.py / ukbx.py generated corpus intelligence
  * ``git``                   — the version-control eligibility boundary + HEAD

``coverage.xml`` is read too, but is deliberately NOT in that list: it is
TEST_EXECUTION_STATE, not repository evidence. Nothing reachable from
:func:`intelligence.rie.engine.build_model` may consume it (UCOS-CL-005), and it
is parsed through the repository's canonical Cobertura reader rather than here
(UCOS-CL-007). See :meth:`EvidenceReader.coverage`.

The reader NEVER writes any of these; it composes them (compose-never-duplicate).
Absent evidence is reported as ``available=False`` and degrades gracefully to a
fail-closed ``INDETERMINATE`` rather than an invented value.

        Repository Fixed-Point Closure (UCOS-RFP-001 RFP-2) — the commit identity
        and branch are excluded (they made every output non-convergent by construction).

        Constitutional classification of inputs (UCOS-UCL-LIFECYCLE):

        ``evidence_files`` (00-BOOK/DATA/*.json) — TRACKED_SOURCE: git-versioned artifacts
        produced by the canonical generation chain (ukb/ukbx). These are the canonical
        identity-determining inputs.

        ``coverage.xml`` — TEST_EXECUTION_STATE / QUALITY_MEASUREMENT: a generated artifact
        produced by the test runner outside the canonical RIB→AEE→RIE chain. It is
        environmental state, not repository truth. Including it in the identity fingerprint
        violates the universal input closure contract: a pristine clone lacks coverage.xml
        because the bootstrap does not run the test suite, so every clone regeneration
        produces a different ``input_hash`` and therefore a different catalog SHA256, causing
        irreproducible ``registry_variance``, ``ordering_variance`` and ``certification_variance``
        in Phase-9 pristine-clone certification.

        Fix, in two parts. UCOS-P0-FCL-002-FIX-001 removed coverage from this fingerprint,
        which made ``input_hash`` deterministic. UCOS-CL-005 completed it: coverage was still
        reaching canonical bytes through ``analysis.py`` (``coverage_line_pct``,
        ``coverage_branch_pct``, ``coverage_full``, and a progress reconciliation branch), so
        the model digest still moved with ``coverage.xml`` while the fingerprint did not. Both
        routes are now closed, and the whole class is held shut by a boundary test asserting
        the serialized model is byte-identical with and without ``coverage.xml``.
