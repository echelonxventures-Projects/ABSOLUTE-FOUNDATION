    UCOS-CL-005 removed the two coverage-derived terms this function used to carry:

    * a ``reconciled = 1.0`` override applied when a LOCALLY_VERIFIABLE dimension read
      BLOCKED while ``coverage.xml`` showed 100% line coverage. Its intent — let locally
      passing evidence outrank a stale BLOCKED signal — was reasonable, but it made
      ``reconciled_score`` and ``dimension_index_reconciled_pct`` a function of whether
      the suite had been run in this working tree. A pristine clone has no coverage.xml,
      so it computed a different progress index from the identical commit.
    * ``unit_validation_pct``, which was ``cov.line_pct`` restated.

    Both are environmental. The reconciled index is now derived from tracked evidence
    alone, so it is identical in a clone and in a tree where tests have run. Coverage as
    a quality signal is unaffected: it is enforced by the ``--cov-fail-under=90`` gate in
    verify.sh, which is where a quality threshold belongs.
