*This artifact is a progress-tracking instrument only. It records status; it creates no authority, alters no determination, and authorizes no EC-series step. It is a **living document**: statuses advance as implementation artifacts are separately authorized and delivered. At the IMP-000 baseline, no implementation artifact (IMP-001…IMP-014) has been created, so every artifact status is NOT STARTED. Governed by the Implementation Governance Baseline and the Technology Constitution.*

## 7. PROGRAM HEALTH DASHBOARD

| Dimension | Status | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Governance foundation | GREEN | IMP-000 package established (plan, constitution, tracker, baseline). |
| Traceability | GREEN | All artifacts trace to baseline + upstream determinations (ISC-06). |
| Authority containment | GREEN | No artifact creates/exercises authority; AUTH-06 respected (C-02, IP-02). |
| Constitutional preservation | GREEN | Determinations consumed read-only; encodings provisional (C-04, C-05). |
| Schedule | GREEN | Baseline complete; IMP-001 authorizable next; no overdue work. |
| Risk posture | AMBER | 14 artifact risks OPEN by nature of not-yet-started work; all have defined mitigations. |
| External gate exposure | AMBER | EC-1…EC-6 remain open (out-of-corpus); affects finality only, not engineering progress. |
| Overall | GREEN | Foundation sound; program ready to authorize IMP-001. |
