"""UCOS-LEDGER-AUTHORITY-001 — the ONE write chokepoint for the identity ledger.

WHERE THIS LIVES, AND WHY IT MOVED. The module was `00-BOOK/tools/ledger_authority.py`, beside
the ledger it guards. That placement cost it three measurements at once, and none of them was a
matter of taste: `00-BOOK` is not a Python identifier, so no coverage source could name the file
(UCI-L-01), no authority claimed it (UCI-L-02), and the two importers reached it through
`sys.path.insert` — an edge Ω-3's import graph cannot resolve, so the one chokepoint every
irreversible allocation passes through was measured as UNREACHABLE, "code that cannot run".
Living beside its data bought proximity and paid for it in three blind spots.

The ledger's LOCATION is unchanged and is not what this module's authority rests on: `commit`
takes the ledger path as an argument and `permit_register_path` derives the permit register from
that argument, so the pair still moves together wherever the caller points it. What changed is
that the code is now importable by name, which is the condition Ω-4's `unnameable_exemptions`
states for a governance engine and the condition UCI-L-01 measures.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`00-BOOK/DATA/id-ledger.json` is GOVERNED EVOLUTION STATE: append-only, irreducible,
not reproducible from the tree (see `ukb.py::cmd_build` and
`GOVERNED-EVOLUTION-STATE-DETERMINATION.md`). Before this module it had FOUR
independent writers reached through FOUR different entrypoints:

    ukb.py:cmd_build      `--mint`                -> by_path,        category_seq, page_cursor
    ukb.py:_exec_declare  `exec declare`          -> by_execution,   category_seq
    uga_engine.py:cmd_run `run`                   -> by_object,      category_seq
    uga_engine.py:cmd_run `run` (same write)      -> by_observation, category_seq

Each writer reported only the counter IT understood. `uga_engine.py::cmd_run` derived
its whole mint report from `epoch1_identity`, which counts `by_object` only, while the
SAME `_dump` persisted observation identities minted by `epoch_observation_universe`.
A run could therefore print `minted=0` while permanently allocating `UCOS-OBS-NNNNNN`
and advancing the shared `category_seq` — a silent irreversible allocation whose only
operator-visible signal said nothing happened.

The defect was never the arithmetic. It was that ALLOCATION and REPORTING were computed
from different scopes. A counter maintained by the caller can only ever measure the
allocations that caller knows about, so every future writer reintroduces the same blind
spot by default.

WHAT THIS FIXES STRUCTURALLY
---------------------------
`commit()` derives the allocation report from the DIFFERENCE between the on-disk
pre-image and the ledger about to be written. The report is therefore a property of the
bytes, not of the caller's bookkeeping: a write that allocates cannot report zero,
because nobody is asked how much they allocated. A writer that invents a fifth identity
map is measured on its first run without touching this module — `IDENTITY_MAPS` is the
only place the vocabulary lives, and an unknown top-level map is reported as
`unmeasured_maps` rather than passing silently.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
----------------------------------
It does not decide WHETHER a mint is permitted. Authorization is the caller's declared
governance boundary (`CORPUS_REGISTRATION` in `mutation-governance-boundary.json`,
REG-AUTO-001 for the corpus, UCOS-UGA-001 for objects) and moving that decision here
would create a second governance authority. This module enforces only the properties
that are true of the ledger under EVERY authority: append-only, no identity reissue, no
counter regression, and total allocation disclosure.

It does not write the ledger's bytes either. The caller supplies its own `writer`, so each
writer keeps its exact existing serialization and idempotency semantics (`ukb._dump_json`
with stamp-equality and the frozen-path telemetry guard; `uga_engine._dump` with byte
comparison). This module adds measurement, refusal and authorization around that write
without introducing an on-disk format of its own.

The one exception is stated rather than hidden: when the persisted document turns out NOT
to be the authorized one, `commit()` restores the pre-image bytes it read moments earlier,
under the lock it still holds. That is a revert, not a format — it re-establishes exactly
the state every pre-write refusal leaves the file in, so a divergent writer and a refused
permit have the same fail-closed outcome. Without it, detection would be an improvement
over silence that still left an unauthorized document permanently on disk.

INVARIANT
---------
`LEDGER-INV-01` (measured by `uga_engine.py`): no source file outside this module may
name the ledger in a write call, or hand a ledger reference to a function that writes its
parameter. That makes a future fifth writer a GATE FAILURE rather than a discovery made
after the identifiers are already permanent. What the invariant cannot see — what a
`writer` does once this module hands it the path — is checked here at runtime instead, by
comparing the persisted document against the authorized one.

# AUTHORIZATION — the permit layer (Phase 2C)
#
# commit() ENFORCES an authorization it does not DECIDE. Who may issue a permit remains
# with the declared governance boundary (REG-AUTO-001 for the corpus, UCOS-UGA-001 for
# objects); this module only verifies mechanical properties of a permit that is presented
# to it. Moving the issuing decision here would create the second governance authority
# this module exists to avoid.
#
# The verification is content-bound rather than identity-bound. A permit names the digest
# of the allocation manifest it approves, and commit() RECOMPUTES that manifest from the
# on-disk pre-image before comparing. Forging a permit therefore requires knowing every
# identifier and counter advance the run will produce — which is the same work as
# reviewing the allocation. That is the property a signature alone would not buy in a
# single-operator repository, where the signer and the executor are the same person.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: The ONE permit register, a sibling of the ledger it authorizes. A SINGLE append-only
#: file, never one file per permit: a new tracked file is an anonymous UCOS-UGA-001
#: object, and clearing that anonymity requires an allocation, which requires a permit,
#: which would be another new file. One register terminates that regress at one object.
#: The name must not end in `-audit.json` — governance_telemetry.forbid_data_telemetry
#: raises for any such path under 00-BOOK/DATA, and the obvious name is the forbidden one.
