"""The impact substrate: the repository's own dependency edges, inverted.

No new graph is built here. Everything is read from surfaces that already exist and
are already gate-measured:

* ``00-MASTER/UCOS-UGA-001/01-EXECUTABLE-OBJECT-REGISTRY.json`` — 4 797 objects, each
  with ``dependencies`` resolved by ``uga_engine.py::python_imports`` to
  repository-relative paths. 816 are ``TEST_OBJECT`` and 774 carry edges.
* ``00-MASTER/UCOS-UGA-001/04-RELATIONSHIP-GRAPH.json`` — the same edge set flattened,
  used for the ``owned_by`` / ``produces`` relations.

Building a second dependency graph would be a second answer to a question the
repository already answers, which ``OBS-INV-13``'s own rationale calls out: "a second
copy of the dependency graph would be a second answer to the same question."

The one thing this module adds is **direction**. The registry stores forward edges
(object → what it imports). Impact analysis needs the reverse (object → who imports
it), and the reverse of a 1-hop edge set is only useful transitively, so
:meth:`ImpactGraph.dependents_of` closes it.
