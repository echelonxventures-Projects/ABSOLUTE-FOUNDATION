"""Measured reality against recognised resolution (`PHASE-UCF-013`).

`PHASE-UCF-011` built the measurement — which providers populate which category — and
could go no further, because the declared side did not exist to read: with no recognition
anywhere in the repository, a populated category could not be told apart from one whose
population anyone had agreed to. Every category collapsed into a single observation, and
the two scenarios that need a declaration were left unwritten rather than faked.

This module covers the join that closes that gap, in two halves.

**The reader** (:mod:`engine.uckp.resolution`) is general by construction: it knows what a
`*_resolution` section *is* and nothing about what any one says. Its tests hold it to
that — discovery by declared suffix rather than by a list, and three states where a naive
reader would have two, so an unreadable source can never be mistaken for one that
declares nothing.

**The join** (:meth:`~engine.uckp.intelligence.UniversalIntelligence.category_integrity`)
compares the two planes and asserts neither. Its tests hold the three states apart —
MATCH, CONFLICT, UNKNOWN — and hold UNKNOWN open: a 22nd category populated tomorrow by a
provider nobody has recognised must report UNKNOWN rather than pass by omission, which is
`PHASE-UCF-005`'s blind spot one layer up.

**The ledger** was written by `PHASE-UCF-015` and is now what the live tests at the foot of
this module read. The three states are still held apart by in-memory fixtures rather than
by the repository's own file, because a suite that could only construct the state its
repository happens to be in would stop being able to test the other two the moment the
file changed. What the live tests add is the pair of claims only the real file can make:
that every category this repository populates is recognised, and that the recognised side
is the measured side — recomputed on both sides, so a fifth provider fails it rather than
extending it.

Nothing here promotes anything. Every state is an OBSERVATION and certification is
indifferent to all of them: the ledger moved the stage from Observational to Advisory, and
a CONFLICT still reports rather than refuses. Promotion needs a plurality-versus-
contamination rule and a certification invariant, both deliberately still deferred.
