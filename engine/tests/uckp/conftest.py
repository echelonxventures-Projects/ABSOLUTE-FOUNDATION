"""Fixtures for the UCKP (Universal Constitutional Knowledge Universe) suite.

The assembled universe is expensive to build — discovery walks the package, ten
persistence adapters are constructed, and the assimilated variant reads and maps 1201
artifacts — so both are session-scoped. They are immutable values, which is what makes
sharing them across tests safe: :class:`ConstitutionalUniverse` is frozen and its
registry, timeline and ledger are append-only, so no test can hand a mutated universe to
the next one.

Tests that need to *break* something build their own small universe from the
``minimal_*`` factories instead.
