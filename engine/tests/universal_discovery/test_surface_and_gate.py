"""The join, the Ω-3 relocation proof, the gate and the scope plugin — over the real repository.

WHY THESE TESTS USE THE REAL TREE. Every phase above is unit-tested against synthetic repositories,
which is the right way to test a rule. But the CLAIM Ω makes is about this repository: that its
governance is total, that no verdict reads a directory name, and that the coverage denominator the
suite actually runs under is derived. A synthetic fixture cannot witness any of those.

# `test_the_gate_refuses_when_a_ratchet_regresses` already makes that argument for Ω-4 and it is
# the same argument for the other four.
#
# The refusals cannot be reached from a repository, either. Ω-2 and Ω-5 are asserted INSIDE
# `surface.build` — `authority.assert_total` and `classification.assert_total` raise before the
# gate could ever see an orphan or an unknown disposition — so a fixture repository that produced
# one would fault during construction rather than reach `evaluate`. The join is what makes those
# arms unreachable from below, and that is a property worth having; it also means the only place
# left to test them is at the join's output.
#
# So `evaluate` is given a surface built by hand, with exactly one criterion falsified in each.
# `surface._totals` computes the totals from those artifacts, so nothing here asserts a number it
# also chose.
