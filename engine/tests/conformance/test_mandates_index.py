# is the opposite of what section 015 asks for.
#
# So absence here is measured against the two producer populations and never against path
# names: the URI generator registry (`ArtifactFamily`), and the generated-artifact registry
# that records every deterministic projection with its producer and regeneration command.

#: Projection -> the URI artifact family whose generator emits it.

# the test used below, in both directions -- a domain has a constitution when such a file
# carries its name, and lacks one when none does.
#
# The distinction the tiers keep is between a CONSTITUTION and an OWNER. Eleven domains have
# a constitution. Five more have no constitution and do have a declared owner -- the root law
# or an instrument the authority alignment register subordinates to it -- which is governance
# without a constitution, not the absence of governance. Eleven have neither.
#
# `UCRD-001-CONSTITUTIONAL-RELATIONSHIP-DETERMINATION.md` is why the rule is the SUFFIX and
# not the word: it carries both "constitutional" and "relationship" and is a determination.
# Matching it would have reported a Relationship Constitution that does not exist.

# stages, and six of those eleven match the stage name EXACTLY -- Knowledge Discovery,
# Capability Discovery, Dependency Discovery, Constraint Discovery, Gap Discovery, Context
# Assimilation. Two documents written apart, six identical phrases.
#
# Four more are performed by an instrument the lifecycle does not name. Four are performed
# by nothing, and PRD section 10 mandates three of the same four -- so the gap is measured
# twice, independently, and the two suites are asserted to agree.

# recording as a fact rather than assumed, because "all located" is exactly the claim a
# sweep would produce by accident.

# Two of the fourteen carry a top-level `authority` key AND are bound in UCOS-CAA-001 as
# subordinate instruments of the root law. That is a strictly stronger standing than a
# module existing, and CAA-INV-02 refuses an authority-carrying register that is not bound,
# so the pair is checked against the binding rather than against the file.
