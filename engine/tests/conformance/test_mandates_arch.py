# The Quality & Trust Fabric ends in Universal Certification and names its verdict set:

# rule "No mandatory obligation may fail." A verdict set is the one part of a governance
# diagram that must exist as VALUES a running instrument can return -- a verdict nothing
# emits is a verdict nobody can receive.
#
# So this binding asks a narrow, checkable question of each: does some instrument in this
# repository emit this verdict? Two do not, and the reasons differ enough to matter.

#: Verdict -> the module that emits it, and the symbol carrying the value.

# that question with thirty-three facets -- "a question every constitutional object must be
# able to answer about itself" -- so the facets are the natural respondent, and the concepts
# they do not cover are the honest measure of the gap between diagram and law.
#
# Three tiers, and the boundary between the first two carries the weight. A FACET is
# carried by every object; a MODULE is a capability the substrate has. "Universal Trust"
# answered by `platform/foundation/trust.py` is a real answer and a weaker one than
# "Universal Identity" answered by a facet every UCKO must fill, and flattening them would

# lifecycle rather than against modules, and `_ucl_stage_names` is imported from the QM-FLOW
# binding rather than rewritten -- one reader of `ucl.json`, not two.
#
# Nine more steps are performed by an instrument the lifecycle does not name as a stage. The
# eighteenth is the interesting one: Go-Live Authorization exists as a DETERMINATION that a
# go-live was accepted, which is a record after the fact and not an authorization gate in a
# pipeline. Counting it as the step would report an authority the repository does not have.
