"""Mandate conformance — the Absolute Universal Constitutional Model (interrogative).

163 mandates over 11 sections. The document is a set of questions every constitutional
object must be able to answer -- WHY, WHAT, WHO, WHERE, WHEN, HOW, WHICH, CAN -- followed by
the CONSTITUTION facets that answer them, the FLOW that produces them and the OUTPUTS.
