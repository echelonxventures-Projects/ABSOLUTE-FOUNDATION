"""The reader every mandate-conformance suite shares, and the two checks each one owes.

WHY THIS IS ONE MODULE AND NOT SIX COPIES. Six suites read the same corpus and make the
same two structural claims about their own tiering. Copied, those claims drift: the fourth
copy forgets disjointness, the fifth widens its absence search, and a suite that has quietly
stopped checking looks exactly like one that passes. UCKP-ART-03 calls a second authoring of
the same knowledge void, and this is the smallest thing that keeps it singular.

WHAT A SUITE OWES, AND WHY BOTH HALVES.

  * TOTALITY — every mandate in the section lands in exactly one tier. Without it a
    mandate can be dropped from the suite and read as passing, because nothing looks for it.
  * NON-VACUITY — the tier meaning "nothing carries this" is searched for, not asserted.
    Without it the absent tier is where anything inconvenient goes, and absence is the one
    claim that costs nothing to make and everything to be wrong about.

WHAT THIS MODULE REFUSES TO DO. It never reads `07-MANDATE-DISPOSITION.json`. That file is
this repository measuring itself, and a conformance suite that checked the measurement
instead of the thing measured would agree with it by construction. Every suite reads the
TRANSCRIPTION -- the documents' own wording -- and asserts against the instruments.
