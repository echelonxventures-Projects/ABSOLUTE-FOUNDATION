"""UCOS-CEP/DPE/ARE — order is derived, dirty state is unmeasurable, replay settles.

The planner tests are mostly about what the planner *refuses to accept*: there is no
argument through which an order can arrive, and a plan over an illegal population is not
executable however well-formed its graph. The state tests force each of the two ways a
seal can be invalid. The replay tests force divergence, which is the branch a correct
system never takes and therefore the one most likely to be wrong.
