"""Ω∞ reference layer — capability declaration, and the refusals that make it worth having.

WHAT THIS LAYER IS FOR. Resolution by capability rather than by name is only meaningful if an
UNDECLARED capability is genuinely unusable. That is a negative property, so most of these tests
assert a refusal: the refusal is the sole observable difference between a capability that was
declared and one that was merely assumed, and a suite that only exercised the happy path would pass
identically against an implementation that assumed everything.
