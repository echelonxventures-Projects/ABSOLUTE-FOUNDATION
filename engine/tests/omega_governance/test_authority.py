"""Ω∞ authority resolution — seven tiers, and a resolution that cannot terminate with nothing.

THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS IS TOTALITY, and it is easy to get almost right. A resolver that returns
``None`` for an unclaimed artifact hands every caller the same decision to make separately, and they
will not make it the same way: one treats it as unowned, one as owned by the caller, one crashes.
``AuthorityResolver`` therefore always returns a chain — but a fallback that quietly succeeded would
be worse than a null, because "nobody owns this" would become indistinguishable from "the universal
authority owns this". The fallback is consequently RECORDED as an event and COUNTED as a density, so
an unowned population stays visible and can be driven down.

CONTESTED IS SURFACED, NEVER RESOLVED. Two sources at one tier claiming different authorities is a
real disagreement between two humans, and picking one by sort order would settle a governance
dispute by alphabet.
