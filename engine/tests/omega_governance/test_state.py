"""Ω∞ governance state — six axes, and the elimination of the silent state.

THE DEFECT THIS VOCABULARY REPLACES. Seven separate vocabularies in this repository each collapsed
governance onto one scalar, and none of them had a word for "we do not know". An artifact that is
GOVERNED and UNMEASURED is the most common artifact there is — a rule claims it and nobody has
observed it yet — and a single-axis vocabulary literally cannot say so. It reports one of the two
and silently drops the other.

WHAT MAKES IT A MECHANISM RATHER THAN A LIST. A ``GovernanceStatus`` holds exactly one position per
REGISTERED axis, so silence is unrepresentable; the transition graph's ABSENCE of an edge is the
refusal, so a state change nobody declared cannot happen by default; and every applied transition
returns an audit record naming the rule that permitted it.
