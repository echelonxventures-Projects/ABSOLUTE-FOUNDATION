"""INV-AGN-02 — a new bypass is refused, and every declared capability is kept.

Two properties, and the second is what makes the first honest. A ratchet on direct callers only
means something if the provider can actually answer the questions those callers ask; before the
capability dispatch existed it declared five capabilities and delivered one, so a caller needing a
content hash had no alternative and counting it as a bypass would have charged the provider's own
gap to its callers.
