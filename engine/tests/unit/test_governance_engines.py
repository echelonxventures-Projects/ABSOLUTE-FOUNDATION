"""Every governance engine under ``00-MASTER/``, loaded and held to one contract.

WHAT THIS CLOSES. Ω-4 measures ``unnameable_exemptions`` — "artifacts no coverage source
could name because their root is not a Python identifier" — and states the condition that
retires it: *"making those engines importable under test rather than only executable as
scripts."* Thirty-nine engines sat behind that measurement; fourteen had a test that
loaded them privately and twenty-five had nothing, so the plane that ENFORCES the
constitution was the plane with the least evidence about it.

THE POPULATION IS DERIVED, NEVER LISTED. ``00-MASTER/*/*_engine.py`` is a glob over the
tree, so an engine added tomorrow is held to this contract on the commit that creates it,
with no edit here. A list would have been the thing this repository has already been
caught by three times — and it would have been a closed enumeration in a file whose whole
subject is refusing them.

WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT. These are smoke properties: an engine
loads, it exposes an entry point, and importing it neither writes to the tree nor exits
the process. That is a floor, not a substitute for the behavioural suites the fourteen
already have and the twenty-five still owe. It is worth landing on its own because a
module that cannot be imported cannot be covered, and because import-time side effects in
a governance engine are the specific defect that makes one dangerous to test at all: an
engine that mutates state or calls ``sys.exit`` on import cannot be exercised by anything.

    libraries with no ``__main__`` at all, loaded by ``assimilation_engine.py`` — for them
    "exposes no entry point" is the correct shape, not a defect, and forcing a ``main()``
    onto a library to satisfy a test would have been the test deforming its subject.

    The property worth holding is weaker and true: nothing here is reachable by NOTHING. An
    engine that no entry point exposes, no ``__main__`` runs and no sibling imports is dead
    code wearing the appearance of enforcement, which is the defect UEC-L-04 names at the

    A ``__main__`` block is the weakest passing form and is deliberately still a pass:
    ``UAKOS-PHASE-001B/provenance_engine.py`` carries its logic inline there, so a test can
    load the module but cannot invoke what it does. That is a real limit on what any suite

# every required stage exits successfully — turned on a number the declaration governing
# the pipeline could not see, could not diff and could not refuse. The engine states the
# principle four lines above where it broke it: "which keys a stage declares is DECLARED,
# never decided here (PR-07 Zero Enumeration)", and the probe's own budget was already
# under declaration as `probe.timeout_seconds`.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM. Declaring the budget does not make STAGE-VERIFY fit inside it.
# Whether verify.sh should run twice inside the fixed-point gate at all is a real capacity
# question with an owner, and raising the declared number to make the overrun disappear
