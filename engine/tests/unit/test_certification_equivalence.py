"""UCI-000001 Part 8 — the equivalence primitives, exercised without paying for a suite run.

WHAT THIS MODULE COVERS AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. ``reproducibility``,
``order_independence`` and ``shard_equivalence`` each run the whole suite inside a frozen
extraction of a commit — minutes of work per call, several times over. Unit-testing them would
mean running the suite from inside the suite. What IS unit-testable is every primitive those three
are assembled from, and that is where their correctness actually lives:

  * ``partition`` — the deliberately independent sharding. Its two refusals are the proof's
    soundness conditions, not conveniences.
  * ``discover_test_modules`` — the filesystem population, kept independent of pytest's plugin set
    so a collection hook cannot shrink the shards and the whole run together.
  * ``_compare_all`` — the N-1 comparison that stands in for N-way equality.
  * ``_collect_failures`` and ``EquivalenceFinding.holds`` — the two ways a proof can fail, kept
    separate because "the runs disagreed" and "a run did not pass" are different findings.

THE EMPTY-POPULATION REFUSALS ARE THE POINT. A shard proof over an empty suite compares nothing to
nothing and reports success; an empty shard contributes no coverage data and makes the combined
total silently smaller than the whole run. Both are asserted below, because both are ways this
module could certify a vacuum.
