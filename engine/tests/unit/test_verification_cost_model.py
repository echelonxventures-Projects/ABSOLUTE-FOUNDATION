"""UVI-000001 Part 10 — the cost table is a MEASUREMENT, so its derivation is measured.

WHY THIS MODULE WAS AT 0%. It runs on demand (`make verify-cost-model`) and inside no verification
mode, by design: a stale table produces a slower plan, never a wrong one. Nothing being a gate is
exactly why nothing exercised it, and the three properties its own docstring says the derivation
depends on — the hidden-duration residual, the content-hash binding, the non-greedy node match —
are each a way the table can become quietly wrong while every run stays green.

THE REGEX IS THE SHARPEST EDGE HERE. The node part is matched non-greedily to end of line rather
than as ``\\S+``, because a parametrised id may contain a space. A whitespace-free pattern drops
exactly those lines, which under-counts the objects most likely to be parametrised and therefore
most likely to be the ones worth splitting. That is asserted directly below.
