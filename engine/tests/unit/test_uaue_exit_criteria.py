"""UAUE-000001 Epoch 6 — the declared exit criteria, and the measurement of them.

Fifteen exit criteria, one per implementation phase, each stating the condition under which that
phase may be called complete. They were declared, loaded into the authority and rendered into the
capability matrix, and evaluated by nothing — which is the defect this repository refuses by rule:
an obligation nothing evaluates is of unknown compliance and may never be presumed satisfied.
Rendered beside a column of declared text, fifteen unmeasured conditions read exactly like fifteen
met ones.

What this suite measures, and the failure each property closes:

1. **Every declared measure is implemented and computed.** A criterion whose measure nothing
   computes is a criterion nobody evaluates.
2. **An uncomputable measure is a refusal, never a zero.** A missing measure defaulting to zero
   would report an unmet exit criterion as met — a false statement rather than a silent one.
3. **The obligation can close.** Each measure is driven to a non-zero count and the gate's verdict
   is required to follow it, because a criterion that cannot fail measures nothing.
4. **The measures are deterministic.** They are read by a rendered register and by a gate that
   must replay, so a measure that varied between calls would break both.
5. **Nothing measures its own output.** No measure reads a rendered register, which is what keeps
   an exit criterion from being satisfied by the file that publishes it.
