"""UISD-000001 — the Universal Infinite Scope and Direction contract, measured.

Organised around the one question that matters for a gate: **can each law fail?** A law
that cannot be made to fail is decoration, and a decorative law would be worse than
none because they would licence the belief that the property had been checked. So for
every law there is at least one test that constructs the violating condition and asserts
the specific refusal.

The other load-bearing tests are:

* :func:`test_the_live_declaration_is_sound_and_open` — the committed declaration measures
  every declared law and refuses none. If this fails, the repository has a real finding.
* :func:`test_measuring_writes_nothing` — the gate is OBSERVE MODE. Proven by hashing the
  whole scanned surface before and after, not by reading the docstring that claims it.
* :func:`test_a_check_no_law_claims_is_refused` — dead code wearing the appearance of
  enforcement is refused in the same breath as a law with no check.
