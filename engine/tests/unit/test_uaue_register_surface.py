"""UAUE-000001 Epoch 6 — the declared register surface.

The defect this surface closes is not "a missing document". The declaration named eighteen
registers and fourteen renderers, the gate measured every certification proof, and then discarded
the measurement: a certification that is correct and unreadable is indistinguishable from a
certification nobody performed. So the surface exists — and a surface that produces files is
exactly the kind of capability that can look present while being absent, which is what this suite
measures.

Six properties, each with the mutation that closes it:

1. **The declaration drives the surface.** Every declared register is rendered, in declared order,
   through a renderer the declaration names. No register file name and no register title appears
   anywhere in the renderer module: a hard-coded name would be the declaration kept in two places,
   and the second copy is the one that goes stale.
2. **Nothing here writes.** The renderer returns bodies. The gate performs every write, under a
   write-scope bound measured in ``test_uaue_evolution_engine.py``.
3. **The bytes are deterministic.** Two renders of one report, and two independent measurements of
   one tree, produce identical bytes — the property the replay proof rests on.
4. **The bytes are reproducible elsewhere.** No memory address, no wall clock, no absolute
   repository root. Measured by poisoning a renderer and requiring the guard to fire: the first
   render of this surface shipped a heap address, the diff was one line, and every count in the
   register was correct, which is the shape of defect a spot read does not catch.
5. **A declared renderer that does not exist is a refusal.** Not a skipped register. A surface that
   wrote seventeen files and reported success would leave one register carrying a previous run's
   measurements, and the gate would still be OPEN.
6. **Drift is detected as bytes.** A hand edit to a committed register is a failure, not a fact.
