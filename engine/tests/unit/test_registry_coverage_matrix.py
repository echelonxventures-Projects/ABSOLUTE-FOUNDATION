"""RCM — the Registry Coverage Matrix, measured.

The matrix answers where every governed object is registered and which registries declare
no authority. These tests hold the properties that make that answer trustworthy — it stores
nothing, the partition is exact, and each failure state is detectable — and they construct
each failure so that no state is asserted without ever having been produced.

The constraint under test throughout: the matrix must not become the 141st registry.

#: The measured raw-path overlap between the two registries: historical identities minted into
#: `id-ledger.json` for objects the CORPUS plane governs — retained, not governed, which is a state
#: the declaration already models and the report already prints. It is held as a RATCHET rather than
#: driven to zero here, because removing an entry from a permanent append-only identity ledger to
#: make a coverage report green would violate identity immutability (UOBC-L-03/L-08) and the
#: single-identity-authority invariant (CAA-INV-04) — repairing a measurement by mutating the thing
#: it measures.
#:
#: THE RULE, STATED PRECISELY. This number may not move SILENTLY. A fall is always welcome and must
#: be recorded. A rise is admissible only when it is measured, explained, and shown to be
#: unpreventable — because both maps that produce it are append-only, so a rise this ratchet could
#: forbid outright would be a ratchet demanding an act the constitution refuses. An unexplained rise
#: is still a failure, and MOVEMENTS below is what separates the two.
#:
#: MOVEMENTS
#:   192 -> 201  (+9)  Recovery integration. Permit P-UCOS-RECOVERY-001 registered 61 documents
#:                     into the CORPUS plane, and nine of them already carried a REPOSITORY-plane
#:                     identity: UCOS-EXDOC-002986/7/8/9/90/91/92/93/94, minted in commits 446…,
#:                     32e…, d19… and d92… long before this transaction. Registering a document the
#:                     repository ledger had already seen puts it in both raw path sets by
#:                     construction. Every one of the nine is EXCLUDED_DOCUMENT, so the REPOSITORY
#:                     plane retains an identity for it and governs nothing — the identical shape as
#:                     the original 192, not a new kind of overlap, and `DUPLICATE_REGISTRATION`
#:                     remains 0. It is irreversible in both directions: `by_object` is append-only
#:                     (UOBC-L-03/L-08) and the corpus registration was an authorized, permanent
#:                     `by_path` allocation. Measured composition at 201: 198 EXDOC, 3 DATAOBJ.
#:   201 -> 210  (+9)  Corpus-registration completion. Permit P-UCOS-CORPUS-003 registered nine
#:                     root-level determination documents into the CORPUS plane, and every one of
#:                     them already carried a REPOSITORY-plane identity minted three commits
#:                     earlier at a4f56e83: UCOS-EXDOC-003048 through UCOS-EXDOC-003056. The shape
#:                     is the 192 -> 201 movement exactly — a document the repository ledger had
#:                     already seen entering the corpus plane puts it in both raw path sets by
#:                     construction — not a new kind of overlap. All nine are EXCLUDED_DOCUMENT, so
#:                     the REPOSITORY plane retains an identity and governs nothing, and
#:                     `DUPLICATE_REGISTRATION` remains 0. Unpreventable in the sense this rule
#:                     requires: refusing the rise would mean refusing either the by_object mint
#:                     (already permanent) or the authorized by_path allocation, and both maps are
#:                     append-only. Measured composition at 210: 207 EXDOC, 3 DATAOBJ.
#:   210 -> 211  (+1)  UAC-000001, the agnosticism conformance harness. Permit P-UCOS-UGA-005
#:                     minted `engine/conformance/axis-register.json` into the REPOSITORY plane as
#:                     UCOS-DATAOBJ-000145, and P-UCOS-CORPUS-006 then registered the same file
#:                     into the CORPUS plane as an ENG declaration document, beside
#:                     `engine/lineage/families.json` and `memory-layers.json`, which is the
#:                     established shape for an engine declaration. A file the repository ledger
#:                     had already seen entering the corpus plane puts it in both raw path sets by
#:                     construction — the same shape as 192 -> 201 and 201 -> 210, not a new kind
#:                     of overlap, and `DUPLICATE_REGISTRATION` remains 0. Measured composition at
#:                     211: 207 EXDOC, 4 DATAOBJ.
#:
#:                     UNPREVENTABLE NOW, AND AVOIDABLE THEN — recorded because this rule asks for
#:                     unpreventability and the honest answer is qualified. Both allocations are
#:                     operator-authorized and permanent, and both maps are append-only, so
#:                     nothing can undo it: unpreventable in exactly the sense the rule requires.
#:                     But the ORDER was a choice. Registering the file into the corpus FIRST
#:                     would likely have removed the by_object requirement entirely — measured in
#:                     the same session, immediately after: registering ADR-0040 and ADR-0041 into
#:                     the corpus left `uga_engine.py run --plan` at total_allocations=0, because
#:                     a document the corpus registry carries is not UGA's subject. The by_object
#:                     mint came first only because the harness was landed before it was
#:                     registered. A future engine declaration should be registered into the
#:                     corpus before any by_object identity is minted for it, and this entry
#:                     exists so that lesson is attached to the number it moved.
