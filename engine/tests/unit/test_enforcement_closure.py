"""UEC-000001 — the non-vacuity and mutation-resistance suite.

WHY THIS FILE IS THE LOAD-BEARING HALF OF THE PROGRAMME.

Twelve laws that hold and cannot be made to fail would measure nothing. That is not a
hypothetical here: it was measured. A one-line ``return True`` inserted into ``compare()`` in
``00-MASTER/UIS-001/uis_engine.py`` and ``00-MASTER/ACEE-000001/acee_engine.py`` flipped both
gates from exit 1 (CLOSED) to exit 0 (OPEN); all nine of UIS's own ``--check-*`` self-guards
still passed; and zero test files in the entire repository reference either programme, so
nothing could kill the mutant.

The same technique applied to UVI's anti-removal laws was killed by five tests
(``test_l03_refuses_a_stage_the_script_does_not_declare`` and four others). That contrast is the
whole finding: the repository already knows how to write a mutation-resistant guard, and had
done it exactly once. This file generalises the pattern to the closure mechanism itself, because
a guard-of-guards that could not refuse would be the most expensive kind of decoration.

STRUCTURE. One reachable PASS (without it every refusal assertion below would be vacuous), then
one independent forged violation per law, then the digest-completeness mutations, then
determinism. Every mutation is applied to a COPY of the declaration or to a throwaway worktree —
never to the repository under test.
