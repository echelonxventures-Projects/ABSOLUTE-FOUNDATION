"""Constitutional governance convergence — non-vacuity suite for the four programmes.

UCOS-UCAF-001 (authority) · UCOS-URAT-001 (ratification) · UCOS-UTCE-001 (traceability) ·
UCOS-UFEP-001 (freeze eligibility).

A gate with no reachable PASS state carries no evidentiary value, and neither does one with no
reachable FAIL state. This repository has recorded the first defect once already
(UCCEP-F-001, FAIL-CLOSED-WITHOUT-PASS-PATH). This suite proves the second cannot occur here:
for each programme it drives the gate CLOSED by a distinct, independent mutation, and proves the
fail-closed abort path is reachable where an unimplemented reader or an unreadable input would
otherwise pass silently.

What is proven, per programme:

  * the gate is OPEN on the committed repository (a reachable PASS state)
  * each declared blocking dimension can be driven to CLOSED by a mutation that targets it
  * a declared validation dimension the engine does not measure FAILS CLOSED rather than
    reporting satisfied — absence of a measurement is never evidence of compliance
  * every declared clause anchor is present in the located instrument it names, so a binding
    cannot silently point at text that does not exist
  * determinism — two renders of one declaration are byte-identical
  * zero enumeration — no identifier the engine acts on is hardcoded in its source
  * write scope — every rendered target resolves inside the programme's own directory

Constitutional properties given their own scenarios, because each is a boundary this work must
not cross:

  * URAT must never record a state reserved to the out-of-corpus finality authority
  * UFEP must never report a subject in a freeze state it cannot reach, and must never act on a
    freeze authorization
  * UTCE must never report a lane population that does not reconcile against the certified
    corpus, and must never read from a path it is permitted to write

Every mutation is hermetic: the declaration is deep-copied in memory and measured directly, so
no scenario writes to the repository or depends on untracked local state.
