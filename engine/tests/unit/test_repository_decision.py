"""UKAP-001 / WP-003 / D-3 — repository decision & action validation suite.

Proves the capability, not a description of it:

  * every evaluated object carries exactly one repository decision      (totality)
  * all six mandated actions are implemented AND reachable
  * every decision maps to exactly one declared rule, which decides that action
  * deterministic replay — the decision re-derives from its recorded grounds ALONE
  * byte-identical regeneration from the committed register
  * Repository Truth preserved — neither prior axis is touched, and nothing is modified
  * Knowledge Once preserved — a second home is refused, never merged into existence
  * dependency closure preserved — no knowledge-modifying action on an open chain
  * traceability preserved — provenance, rule, operation, owner and grounds on every decision
  * backward compatibility — a pre-D-3 record still deserializes, and fails closed

The unit scenarios are hermetic: synthetic rows are built in-process, so the suite never needs
the external evidence tree.
