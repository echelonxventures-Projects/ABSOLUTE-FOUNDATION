"""UAKOS-CLOSURE-009 — Universal Constitutional Assimilation Programme validation suite.

This suite exists because UCOS-RIB-001 measured the programme's engine as BOTH a dead
engine (``VER-11`` / ``GAP-DEAD-ENGINE``: no declared entry point named it) and an orphan
capability (``VER-09``: unreachable in every declared reachability dimension). REG-AUTO-001
P7 requires enforceability by *tooling gates* rather than author discipline — at least one
Makefile target, at least one workflow and at least one test. This file is the test leg of
that discharge, and it is deliberately not a smoke test: the consequence of the engine being
unreachable was that nothing re-ran it, so its committed registers were left rendered
against a stale HEAD and reported 89 inherited concept gaps that Repository Truth had
already closed. An engine no target names is an engine nobody re-runs, and a register nobody
re-runs is a register that silently stops being true.

What is proven here, in the order the defects actually appeared:

  * committed registers are CURRENT       — they agree with the closure register they measure
  * replay is stable across the commit    — the recorded HEAD is reused, never re-read
  * requirement identity is derived       — RR-<CONCEPT-ID>, total and injective, CREATE = 0
  * measurement is fail-closed            — an absent required input asserts no verdict
  * no wall-clock is emitted              — regeneration is reproducible
  * reachability is mechanized            — the Makefile and workflow legs cannot regress

The suite is read-only over the repository: it never invokes the engine's writing path, so
running it cannot modify a single register.

    Every one of these fields is COPIED from the closure register at render time, so a
    disagreement means the committed register was rendered against a superseded substrate.

    P0-FINAL-CONVERGENCE-001. The commit sha is deliberately NOT compared for equality with
    the live closure register. It cannot be: `closure.json` records `git rev-parse --short
    HEAD` at generation time, so requiring the COMMITTED register to carry it demands that a
    committed artifact carry the sha of the commit that carries it — the exact impossibility
    `_head_commit` exists to prevent, in this module's own words. Git history shows the chase
    it produced, four generations deep: a5ff49a recorded 75166e2, c4a3a10 recorded 89d3baf,
    32a0f36 recorded 05ce974, b71b1e8 recorded d64fbb8 — every register naming its
    predecessor, one commit message reading "the register catches up to the commit that moved
    the corpus". The equality was therefore unsatisfiable at EVERY committed state, and once
    verify.sh regenerates closure.json on every run it fails at every commit rather than
    erroring on an absent file.

    What must agree is the MEASUREMENT the register copied, not the provenance sha. The three
    substantive fields below are what actually detect the original defect (a stale register
    reporting 89 phantom gaps Repository Truth had closed): a register rendered against a
    superseded substrate disagrees on determination, gap_total or concept_total. Detection is
    preserved; only the unsatisfiable provenance equality is dropped, and the sha is still
    required to be present and non-empty.

    legitimate ADDITION to the canonical collection broke it.

    UCI-000001 — and it broke again, the same way, for the same reason. Reading ``testpaths``

    more roots were admitted, wiring up 3,995 tests that no runner collected), ``startswith
    ("testpaths")`` matched ``testpaths = [`` and every root moved to a line this check never
    read. Twice is a pattern, so the scrape was replaced by a TOML parse.

    UCOS-OMEGA-001 — and a TOML parse broke it a THIRD time, because it was still a question
    about a LIST. ``testpaths`` no longer exists: Ω-1 derives the collection set from which
    directories hold suites, so the honest form of this check is to ask the derivation whether it
