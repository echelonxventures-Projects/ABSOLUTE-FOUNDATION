"""UAUE-000001 Epoch 4 — the autonomous evolution controller.

Epoch 3 proved eleven functions correct in isolation. What it could not prove is that anything
carries a candidate through all of them: the traversal lived in a test helper, which meant the
*claim* being made — that this repository can evolve an arbitrary subject without being told what
it is — was demonstrated by the test suite rather than by the platform. A capability whose only
implementation is its own test is not a capability.

The properties measured here, and the failure each one closes:

1. **A candidate reaches a certified evolution.** One admitted candidate traverses all eleven
   declared positions, settles, and satisfies every declared validation dimension, verification
   dimension and certification proof — through the controller, with no test-side wiring.
2. **Runs replay.** Two conducted runs of one candidate produce one run identity and one digest,
   through the same number of settlement rounds. Determinism is claimed about the *path*, not only
   the destination, because a run that reached the same place by a different route would make the
   settlement bound unmeasurable.
3. **The unknown subject needs nothing new.** The declared probe and a subject of a class this
   suite invents both traverse the identical code path, produce the identical run shape, and add
   no registry, authority, engine or schema. An unknown object is admitted through the same door
   as everything else or the door is not universal.
4. **Every refusal is a refusal.** Missing identity, missing subject, missing evidence, an
   unresolved dependency, a failed validation, a failed verification, a failed certification and
   an unauthorised execution each drive the controller to refuse — and each for its own named
   reason, so a gate that always passed could not go unnoticed.
5. **The fixed point is a fixed point.** The settlement converges, converges in the same number of
   rounds every time, terminates at its ceiling rather than spinning, and — the property that
   makes it a settlement at all — one more round after convergence changes nothing.
6. **The conductor carries no knowledge of its subject.** The controller source names no phase,
   register, object kind, criterion, candidate class or domain. Measured against the declaration
   rather than asserted, so a literal added tomorrow fails this test.
