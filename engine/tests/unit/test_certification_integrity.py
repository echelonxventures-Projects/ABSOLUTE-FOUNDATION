"""UCI-000001 — non-vacuity suite for the certification integrity programme.

A gate with no reachable PASS state carries no evidentiary value, and neither does one with no
reachable FAIL state. This suite proves both directions for every law, and it proves them by
MUTATING the measured input rather than by calling the law with hand-built arguments: a law tested
against a fixture it never sees in production is a law tested against a different function.

WHAT IS PROVEN

  * the gate is OPEN on the measured working tree (a reachable PASS)
  * every law REFUSES when its debt grows by one (a reachable FAIL, per law)
  * the ratchet is ONE-sided — a repayment is accepted with no edit anywhere, because Ω-4 replaced
    a two-sided ceiling that refused any measurement below the declared value and so made every
    improvement a chore indistinguishable from a retreat
  * a declared ceiling that binds no measurement is refused
  * the coverage reader reproduces coverage.py's own totals, so it is reading and not guessing
  * the coverage comparison detects a single moved line, which is the granularity Rules 8/10/11
    depend on and the granularity a percentage comparison does not have
  * statement attribution PARTITIONS: object counts sum to the set the surface distributed
    (the AST statements, intersected with coverage's own countable lines when a report names
    the file), and never exceed the file's AST count
  * the shuffle plugin is inactive without a seed, reproducible with one, and genuinely reorders
  * the extraction seal is deterministic, and the fingerprint detects a moved tree
  * an empty or single shard partition is refused rather than silently measured

The suite deliberately does NOT run the test suite, build a virtualenv or measure coverage. Those
are the expensive measurements the programme exists to take; asserting them here would make this
file a second, slower copy of them.

    The `report` fixture is `contract.measure(str(REPO))`, which reads the checkout as it stands —
    committed, staged and modified content alike. This test was named for "the committed
    repository" and its failure message said so, which is true only when the tree happens to be
    clean. On a dirty tree it attributed uncommitted work to HEAD and sent a reader to `git log`
    for a cause sitting in `git status`; the measured refusal named `00-BOOK/tools/*` offenders
    that are present in the checkout and absent from the commit.

    MEASURING THE COMMIT INSTEAD WOULD MAKE THE OLD NAME TRUE AND THE TEST VACUOUS, which is why
    the name was corrected rather than the subject. A frozen extraction of HEAD carries HEAD's
    declaration, whose ratchet keys are NUMBERS — `contract` refuses that as a FAULT under Ω-4 —
