"""B-02 — the persisted Universal Constitutional Identifier Dictionary.

The dictionary was already derived, verified, serialisable and replayable; what it never
had was a written artifact, a producer contract and a gate. These tests measure the four
properties that make a persisted projection trustworthy — authority, determinism, replay
and integrity — and the three refusals that make them non-vacuous.

The artifact is DERIVED TRUTH. Every assertion below is written so that it would fail if
the file were ever hand-authored: the committed bytes are compared against a freshly
computed projection, never against a stored expectation.
