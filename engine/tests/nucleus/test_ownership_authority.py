"""UCOS-NUC-001 Part 11 — ownership has exactly one authority, and it is CEU.

The convergence claim: ``Ownership(legacy) == Ownership(CEU)`` for every role, and the
legacy surface is a *projection* rather than a second authority.

The distinction between those two is not rhetorical, and one test settles it: strip the
ownership faculty from the CEU classification and the legacy property must change. An
authority would keep answering from itself; a projection follows its source. That test is
the reason this file exists.
