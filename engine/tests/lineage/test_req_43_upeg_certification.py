"""REQ-43 UPEG (Universal Persistent Evolutionary Graph) Certification.

This module certifies REQ-43: Universal Persistent Evolutionary Graph operational
with complete test coverage and documentation.

UPEG is implemented as Universal Lineage Projection Part 05 (engine/lineage/memory.py).
It resolves memory across seven layers by projecting over existing governed records:
identity, context, relationship, knowledge, evidence, decision, evolution.

Key properties (ADR-0013):
- Memory persistence (outlives process)
- Lineage preservation (supersession, resurrection)
- Historical reconstruction (repeatable, byte-identical)
- No duplicate truth (one governed record per value)
- No duplicate authority (one owner per layer)
- No orphan memory (subject, layer, owner, source required)
- Open world (unknown subject → empty, not error)
- No clock (owner's recorded sequence, no time parsing)

# governed records, which are present, well-formed and shaped exactly as the declaration
# says. Every branch that exists for a record that is none of those things was therefore

# not a number, and every rendering `_scalar` performs for a value that is not a string.
# An open-world projection is defined by what it declines to call a fault, so the
