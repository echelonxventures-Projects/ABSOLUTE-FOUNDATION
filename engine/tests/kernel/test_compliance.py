# ------------------------------------------------ the negative mandates, bound to evidence
#
# Thirty-seven of the 1,449 mandates in `00-MASTER/CAEM-001/06-MANDATE-CORPUS.json` assert
# an ABSENCE -- "No fixed planets", "New domains require no redesign". CAEM-001 dispositions
# every one of them ASSERT, for a stated reason: corpus search cannot decide a negative.
# Finding the token proves nothing and not finding it proves nothing either.
#
# What CAN decide them is an executed instrument, and this module already runs one. The
# tests above prove the MECHANISM works; none of them names a MANDATE, so nothing tied the
# two together. These do.
#
# SCOPE, STATED ONCE AND HONESTLY. `engine/kernel/compliance.py` measures `engine/kernel/**`.
# It proves the kernel seeds no prohibited category and can represent every one of them by
# registration. It does NOT prove the property for the whole repository, and CAEM-001's
# own hard-coded-assumption register says so ("scoped to engine/kernel/** only"). A binding
# below is therefore evidence FOR a mandate at kernel scope, never a discharge of it.
