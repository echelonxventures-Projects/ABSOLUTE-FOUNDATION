"""UCI-000001 Part 5 — certification from an immutable extraction (mandate Rule 7).

WHY A MUTABLE TREE CANNOT BE CERTIFIED, stated as the incident that produced this module.

While this package was being written, a second process in the same working tree ran
``./verify.sh --full``. It rewrote ``coverage.xml``, and a read of that file mid-write raised
``not well-formed (invalid token): line 90558``. HEAD also advanced twice during the same
interval. Neither event was visible to any gate: every gate in the repository reads the working
tree as it finds it, so a run that measures a tree while something else edits it reports a figure
that is attributable to no commit at all. That is a false green of the purest kind — not a wrong
number, but a number that is not ABOUT anything.

``git archive <sha>`` is the remedy the mandate names, and it has a property a ``git clone`` does
not: it emits exactly the tracked content of one commit, with no ``.git``, no untracked files, no
ignored files and no ability to be advanced. A run inside the extraction cannot see the working
tree, so it cannot be contaminated by one.

WHAT IS CHECKED BESIDES THE EXTRACTION.

Extraction alone proves the INPUT was frozen. It does not prove nothing changed while the
measurement ran, because a run can take twenty minutes and read the outer repository through an
absolute path by mistake. So ``run`` samples the outer repository's fingerprint — HEAD, the
porcelain status, and the digest of the tracked file list — before and after, and refuses on any
difference. The two checks answer different questions and neither implies the other.

THE INTERPRETER IS PART OF THE MEASUREMENT. A frozen tree measured by an interpreter whose
site-packages point at the UNfrozen tree is not a frozen measurement: an editable install
resolves ``import engine`` through a meta-path finder that wins over ``sys.path``, so the
extraction would execute the working tree's code while appearing to execute its own. This module
therefore builds a virtualenv INSIDE the extraction and installs the extraction into it. That
cost — roughly one to three minutes with a warm pip cache — buys the only thing that makes the
run citable.

    ``engine/execution_environment/discovery.py:79`` raises "no repository root could be resolved
    ... git did not answer and no .git was found" and pytest aborts during collection. It is not an
    isolated case: ``engine/enforcement_closure/discovery.tracked_paths`` treats a missing work tree
    as a FAULT by design, and every gate that derives its population from ``git ls-files`` does the
    same. So an extraction with no git is not a stricter measurement — it is an unmeasurable one.

    A sealed extraction is STRICTER than the working tree it came from, not weaker: the commit
    contains exactly the tracked content of the source SHA, there are no untracked or ignored files
    to leak in, ``git status`` is clean by construction, and nothing can advance HEAD because
    nothing else knows the repository exists. The seal's own SHA is deterministic, so it is
