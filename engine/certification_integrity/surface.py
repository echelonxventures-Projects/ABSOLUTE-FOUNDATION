"""UCI-000001 Part 3 — the executable surface, enumerated by rule.

WHAT AN "EXECUTABLE OBJECT" IS HERE.

Every tracked ``.py`` file, and inside it every class, function and method, plus the four
non-Python executable kinds the repository actually runs: console entry points, module CLIs,
``verify.sh`` stages and the ``00-MASTER`` governance engines. The population comes from
``git ls-files``, never from a list, for the reason ``engine/enforcement_closure/discovery.py``
states: a hand-written list of what exists agrees with itself forever.

THE DENOMINATOR IS A PROPERTY OF THE OBJECT, NOT OF THE MEASUREMENT.

The central move of this module is that ``measured`` is computed from the declared coverage
scope in ``pyproject.toml`` and attached to every object, so "0% covered" and "not in the
denominator" can never again be read as the same fact. They were previously indistinguishable,
because an unmeasured file simply does not appear in ``coverage.xml`` and absence renders as
nothing rather than as zero.

ATTRIBUTION PARTITIONS. A method's statements belong to the method, not also to its class and
its module. Nesting the counts would let one statement be covered three times and make the
totals exceed the file, so every line is attributed to its innermost enclosing object and the
module keeps only what no class or function encloses. The consequence worth stating: summing
``statements`` over all objects of a file equals the file's statement count exactly, which is
the invariant ``contract`` asserts rather than assumes.
