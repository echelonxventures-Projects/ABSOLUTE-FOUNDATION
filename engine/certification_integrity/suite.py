"""UCI-000001 Part 6 — running the test suite so that two runs are comparable.

ONE RUNNER, THREE RULES. Rules 8, 9, 10 and 11 all reduce to "run the suite under a stated
variation and compare the coverage line sets". They therefore share one runner, because four
runners would let four answers disagree about what "the suite" means — and the repository has
already been bitten by exactly that: ``addopts`` and ``[tool.coverage.run] source`` were two
declarations of one denominator, reconciled by nobody.

WHAT IS HELD FIXED, AND WHY EACH ONE MATTERS.

  * ``COVERAGE_FILE`` is set explicitly per run and never inherited. ``execution.py`` records
    that an ambient value once corrupted a parent's data file.
  * ``PYTHONHASHSEED`` is pinned. Unpinned, dict and set iteration order varies per process, so
    a run-to-run coverage difference could be caused by the harness rather than by the code, and
    Rule 11 would report drift that is really only hash randomisation.
  * ``--cov-fail-under=0`` on every measured run. The floor is a separate decision applied once
    over the combined data; a shard that failed the floor individually would abort before writing
    its data and the combine would then silently measure less.
  * ``-p no:cacheprovider`` so no run can be influenced by the previous run's cache. Without it,
    ``--lf``-style state and stored durations make run B a function of run A, which is precisely
    the independence Rule 11 requires.
