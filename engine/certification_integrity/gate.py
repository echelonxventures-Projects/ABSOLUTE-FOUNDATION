"""UCI-000001 Part 10 — the gate. Fail-closed, read-only, three-valued.

    exit 0  OPEN    every blocking law was measured and holds
    exit 1  CLOSED  a blocking law was measured and REFUSED
    exit 2  FAULT   no verdict could be reached — the declaration is absent or unparseable, the
                    tracked-path boundary could not be established, or a coverage measurement
                    named on the command line could not be read

The third code is load-bearing and is not a convenience. "The executable surface is fully
governed" and "the executable surface could not be enumerated" are different facts, and a gate
that collapsed them would let a broken enumerator certify an empty repository. A FAULT is never
"skip": the caller's fail-safe on 2 is to treat certification integrity as UNPROVEN.

WRITES NOTHING BY DEFAULT. ``--inventory`` prints the inventory to stdout. ``--write-inventory``
exists because the mandate names ``coverage_gap_inventory.json`` as a required artifact, and it
writes ONLY that file, which no law in this package reads back. The asymmetry is the mechanism:
nothing this gate emits can turn one of its own refusals into a pass, so regenerating an artifact
can never be a way to satisfy a law.
