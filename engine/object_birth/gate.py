"""UOBC-000001 Part 05 — the fail-closed birth gate.

Exit codes follow the repository convention so a caller can distinguish the three
outcomes that matter:

    0  OPEN    every law holds
    1  CLOSED  a law was measured and refused
    2  FAULT   no verdict could be reached (the declaration or ledger is unusable)

The distinction between 1 and 2 is deliberate. "The contract is violated" and "the
contract could not be read" are different facts, and collapsing them would let an
unreadable declaration masquerade as a pass or a failure depending on which was more
convenient.

Read-only and hermetic: it loads the declaration and the ledger, computes, and writes
nothing. No clock, no network, no subprocess. That is what makes it safe to wire into
``./verify.sh`` without it being able to dirty the tree or flake.
