"""TASK-000054 — Program Closure Report (EPIC-008).

The **Program Closure Report** is the EC-1 program-closure certification: a
deterministic, evidence-only attestation over the delivered EC-1 Execution Engine.
It renders the EC-1 **acceptance framework** (A1…A10) — one row per delivered
capability area — and closes the program with a verdict.

Following the non-optimistic discipline (OP-CERT-001), the closure is *fail-closed*
and *evidence-based*: A1…A9 attest capability areas delivered by the completed epics
EPIC-001…EPIC-007 (whose completion reports are the standing evidence), while **A10
(Certification Framework) is computed live** from the append-only certification
ledger — PASS iff the ledger is non-empty, every entry is CERTIFIED, and the hash
chain verifies. The overall verdict is **PASS** iff every acceptance row is PASS.

The report embeds no wall-clock or ambient state and is content-addressed, so the
same ledger yields a byte-identical closure report (reproducible). It asserts
``ENGINEERING-EXECUTION-ONLY`` authority and carries the EC-1 provisional-state
disclosure — program closure records engineering readiness, not constitutional
finality (DE-05 / IP-01): the external gates (EC-1…EC-6) remain open.
