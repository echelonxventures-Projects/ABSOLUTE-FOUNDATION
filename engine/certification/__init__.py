"""EC-1 Certification Layer (EPIC-008) — deterministic, immutable certification.

Public API surface for the Certification Layer: an additive, record-only certifier
that consumes the Validation Reports and Validation Evidence produced by the
Validation Layer (EPIC-007) and aggregates their verdicts into:

    * a **Certification Decision** (fail-closed CERTIFIED / NOT-CERTIFIED),
    * an **immutable, content-addressed Certification Record**,
    * a **Certification Evidence** record (closing the Validation → Certification
      evidence chain),
    * an append-only, hash-chained **Certification Ledger Entry**, and
    * an EC-1 **Program Closure Report** (the A1…A10 acceptance framework).

The layer is additive and constitutional: it invents no verdict (TP-01 — it only
aggregates validation), mutates no subject, accesses the registry only through the
already-validated upstream artifacts (never a direct corpus/registry write, DP-03),
and is fully deterministic (IMP-007 §5) — an identical Validation Report +
Validation Evidence yields a byte-identical decision, record, evidence, ledger
entry, and closure report. Certification records **engineering readiness only** and
carries the EC-1 provisional-state disclosure — it confers no constitutional
finality or authority (DE-05 / IP-01).

Tasks: TASK-000050 (architecture + contracts + record + criteria), TASK-000051
(decision engine), TASK-000052 (evidence), TASK-000053 (ledger), TASK-000054
(program closure report).
