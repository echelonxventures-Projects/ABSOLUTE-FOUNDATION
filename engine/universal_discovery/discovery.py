"""UCOS-OMEGA-001 Part 2 (Ω-1) — the population, discovered rather than declared.

THE ONE INPUT IS ``git ls-files '*.py'``.

Not the filesystem, for the reason ``platform/tests/test_coverage_scope.py`` already records: a
control that enumerates the working copy decides differently on a developer's machine than on a
clean checkout, and a control whose verdict depends on local debris gets suppressed. Version
control is the eligibility boundary everywhere else in this repository and it is the boundary
here.

Not a list, for the reason this whole package exists: ``SOURCE_TREES = ("engine", "platform")``
was true when it was written and wrong for five roots afterwards, and nothing could say so,
because a list has no term for what it omits.

EVERY DERIVATION BELOW IS A PROPERTY, NOT A NAME.

  root                — the first path segment of a tracked ``.py`` file. Whatever it is.
  importable root     — that segment is a Python identifier, so a coverage source can name it.
                        ``00-MASTER`` is not one; ``quantum`` would be. The rule is the
                        language's, so no future root can be admitted or refused by taste.
  test root           — the shallowest directory under a root that holds tracked ``test_*.py``.
                        Discovered from the naming pytest itself collects on, applied to
                        whatever tree carries it.
  measurable package  — an importable root's coverage unit. If the root holds modules DIRECTLY
                        it is itself the unit; otherwise each sub-directory carrying tracked
                        Python is. That distinction is measured from the tree, and it is exactly
                        the distinction the hand-written 78-entry list encoded by hand: ``engine``
                        and ``platform`` hold only ``__init__.py`` at their top level and were
                        listed per sub-package; ``service``/``data``/``application``/
                        ``infrastructure``/``intelligence`` hold modules and were listed whole.

A SUB-PACKAGE PREDICATE THAT CANNOT MISS PEP 420. "Contains any tracked ``.py`` at any depth",
never "contains ``__init__.py``". The second predicate is what put ``engine/recursive_knowledge``
— sixteen modules, 2,849 statements, a live gate, a ``verify.sh`` stage, a workflow and 135
tests — outside the denominator while every scope test passed.

    THREE PROPERTIES, ALL MEASURED, NONE OF THEM A DIRECTORY NAME.

      1. it is a test module by the convention pytest itself collects on; or
      2. it is suite support — ``conftest.py`` is pytest's fixture mechanism and ``__init__.py``
         is how a tree becomes importable — sitting above a subtree that holds test modules; or
      3. its OWN directory directly holds test modules, and no module outside that directory's
         subtree imports it.

    Property 3 is the load-bearing one, and the locality is exactly what makes it correct. The
    repository holds eighteen suite helpers carrying no ``test_`` prefix —
    ``platform/tests/_coverage_helpers.py``, ``engine/tests/uckp/doubles.py`` and sixteen more —
    and a name-keyed predicate declared their trees "not test directories", which would put
    ``engine.tests`` and ``platform.tests`` into the coverage denominator: 234 test modules
    measured as though they were the product.

    A LOOSER VERSION OF PROPERTY 3 WAS MEASURED AND REJECTED. "No module outside this DIRECTORY
    imports it" swallowed ``service``, ``data``, ``application`` and ``infrastructure`` whole —
    those four layers have zero inbound imports from anywhere else in the repository, so at root
    level every one of their modules trivially satisfied it and all four were classified as test
    trees. Requiring the module's own directory to hold test modules DIRECTLY separates the two
    cases on a property the import graph cannot supply: ``platform/tests`` sits beside its tests,
    ``service/policy.py`` does not.
