"""UCOS-UICM-000001 — population assembly and the capability x dimension closure matrix.

This module is the home of the first capability UICM was admitted to create: **the
capability x dimension closure matrix**. Discovery established that no artifact in the
repository crosses those two axes. ``UAKOS-CLOSURE-002`` measures 549 *concepts*;
``UAKOS-CLOSURE-009`` projects them into requirements carrying one scalar maturity level
each and measures its fifteen lifecycle dimensions *repository-wide* rather than per
capability. The question "is capability X closed on dimension Y?" had no answer anywhere,
and this module is that answer.

The population is **read, never invented**. Three canonical owners supply every field:

    capability identity      knowledge/canonical-knowledge.json   (UCKO-CAP-*)
    artifact identity        00-MASTER/UCOS-UGA-001               (UCOS-* universal_id)
    implementation mapping   intelligence/UCOS-RIE-CAPABILITY-CATALOG.json

A capability is admitted only when the tracked boundary, the capability register and the
implementation catalogue *all three* name it. That conjunction is what makes "no invented
capability" a measurement rather than a promise: this module cannot produce a capability
that the canonical owners do not already carry, because it has no code path that
constructs one from anything else.

Note the import discipline. The implementation catalogue is consumed as **JSON**, never by
importing ``intelligence``: that package depends on ``engine``, so an import in this
direction would invert the layering and create a cycle. The dependency is on a file
format, which is exactly what a reference into another owner's register should be.
