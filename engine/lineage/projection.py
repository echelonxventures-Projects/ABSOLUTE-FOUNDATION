"""ULP Part 03 — the projection generator and its validation.

Composition, not collection. Each family is built from the source that OWNS that meaning:

    structure     ← artifacts.json parent, via the typed edges already projected from it
    dependency    ← declared metadata rows, via the same typed edges
    derivation    ← generated-artifact-registry producer + input_closure
    supersession  ← change-ledger lineage predecessors/successors
    transformation← change-ledger change_events  (EVENTS, never edges)

Determinism is structural rather than promised: every collection is sorted on a total key
before it is emitted, nothing reads a clock, and no path or machine identifier enters the
document. Two builds over one repository state produce identical bytes, and
:func:`verify` proves it by building twice.

The generator writes NOTHING. A lineage store is what ``UCI-001 XVI.5`` forbids — *"lineage
and evolution are DERIVED projections over recorded history; no new store is created"* — so
the document exists to be compared and queried, not to be kept.
