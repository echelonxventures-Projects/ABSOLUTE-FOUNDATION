"""ULP Part 05 — universal persistent evolutionary graph memory, resolved by projection.

Lineage answers **"how did this become this?"** for one family of relations at a time.
Memory answers the wider question **"what does the repository remember about this?"** — and
it answers it by asking the owners that already remember, in a declared order:

    identity → context → relationship → knowledge → evidence → decision → evolution

**This module is not a memory engine and must never become one.** It creates no store,
opens no counter, mints no identifier, declares no relation and writes no file. It obeys the
same law the rest of this package obeys, ``UCI-001 Part XVI.5``: *"lineage and evolution are
DERIVED projections over recorded history; no new store is created."* Every value it returns
cites the governed record it came from, so a caller can follow any answer back to the owner
that declared it. A value that cannot name its source is not returned.

The layer set is **data**, not code — ``engine/lineage/memory-layers.json``. A seven-member
layer set written into source would be an undisclosed finite assumption about how many kinds
of memory can exist (``ADR-0007``). Declared as data, an eighth layer is admitted by naming
its owner, its record and its access shape, with no code change here.

Two properties are load-bearing and are asserted by the verification suite rather than
assumed:

**Open world.** An unknown subject is not an error and not a guess. Every declared layer
resolves, and a layer with nothing recorded for that subject comes back empty with
``recorded=False``. The distinction between *"the owner records nothing"* and *"the record is
absent"* is kept, because collapsing them would hide a missing register behind a normal-
looking empty answer.

**No clock.** Ordering uses each owner's own recorded sequence. Where an owner records a
wall-clock string it is carried verbatim as opaque data and never parsed, compared or
normalised — parsing it would import a calendar, and ``engine/temporal/operations.py``
refuses a clock read for exactly that reason.
