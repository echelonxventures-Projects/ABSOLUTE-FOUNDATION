"""RCM — the Registry Coverage Matrix.

Answers: **what governed objects exist, where are they registered, who owns the
registration plane, and what coverage gaps exist?**

It is coverage INTELLIGENCE, not a registry. The distinction is structural rather than
promised: this module stores no object record. Every object it reports is read from the
plane that already registers it, and every ownership it reports is read from the instrument
that already declares it. A matrix that kept its own copy would be the duplicate-catalogue
defect it exists to detect — the 141st registry.

Every mechanism, plane, disclosed gap and scan root is DATA in ``declarations.json``.
There is no registry path, no object class and no gap id below.

**W5-G1 is disclosed, never inferred.** Eight producer outputs carry no declared authority.
The producer that writes each one is *recorded* and explicitly *not adopted* as its owner:
inferring ownership permanently would manufacture the very declaration the finding says is
missing. Disclosure keeps the gap countable while its remediation stays with the owner it
is referred to — and an UNDISCLOSED registry with no authority is a violation, which is what
makes the disclosure a ratchet rather than an excuse.
