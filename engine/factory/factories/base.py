"""TASK-000042 — Common factory contract (EPIC-006).

Every factory implements the **same** contract and shares the **same** execution
path. A factory is a thin strategy object that binds a blueprint class to a
:class:`~engine.factory.contracts.FactoryCapability`; it holds **no** pipeline
logic of its own. Generation is delegated, unchanged, to the orchestrator's
execution path (:class:`FactoryExecution`), so there is exactly one implementation
of compile + assemble across the whole layer (no duplicated pipeline logic, no
special-case paths).

    * :class:`FactoryExecution` — the structural interface the orchestrator
      satisfies; ``execute(context)`` runs the certified compiler + runtime path.
    * :class:`ExecutionContext` — the immutable inputs handed to an execution.
    * :class:`Factory` — the structural contract every factory satisfies.
    * :class:`BaseFactory` — the shared implementation; concrete factories only
      declare their class, name, and capability.
