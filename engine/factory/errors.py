"""TASK-000038 — Factory Layer error taxonomy (EPIC-006).

The Factory Layer reuses the EC-1 Foundation error discipline (TASK-000006):
every error is rooted in :class:`FoundationError`, carries a stable,
category-prefixed ``code`` and structured, non-secret ``context`` so failures are
auditable (PL-02, IP-12) and machine-consumable.

The Factory Layer is a *thin, additive orchestration model* over the certified
compiler and runtime subsystems: it classifies blueprints from registry metadata,
routes them to a registered factory, and executes the existing pipeline. It
invents no behaviour (TP-01) — a class it cannot classify, a factory it cannot
resolve, or a duplicate registration all fail loudly with a specific error.
