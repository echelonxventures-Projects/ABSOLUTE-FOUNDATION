"""UVI-000001 Part 07 — composing one deterministic verification plan.

The plan is the whole decision, taken once, before anything executes: which declared
stages run, which are answered from evidence, which the mode does not admit, what the
test selection is, and how it is partitioned. ``./verify.sh`` then executes the plan
rather than deciding as it goes, which is what makes the run reproducible and what makes
``UVI-L-10`` — plan twice, get identical bytes — a meaningful measurement rather than a
statement of intent.

No wall clock, no host name, no absolute path reaches a plan. Those are observations of
one run on one machine, and a plan that carries them cannot be compared with the plan
another machine produced from the same state.
