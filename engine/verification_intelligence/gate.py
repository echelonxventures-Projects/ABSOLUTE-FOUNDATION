"""UVI-000001 Part 08 — the fail-closed verification intelligence gate.

Exit codes follow the repository convention so a caller can distinguish the three
outcomes that matter:

    0  COHERENT    every law holds
    1  INCOHERENT  a law was measured and refused
    2  FAULT       no verdict could be reached (the declaration is unusable)

The distinction between 1 and 2 is deliberate. "A mode claims more than it measures" and
"the declaration could not be read" are different facts, and collapsing them would let an
unreadable declaration pass as whichever was more convenient.

OBSERVE MODE — READ ONLY. It loads the declaration, reads ``verify.sh`` and the engine's
own sources, plans in memory, and writes nothing — including to gitignored paths. No
clock, no network, no subprocess, so it cannot dirty the tree and cannot flake.

Every law is COMPUTED. UVI-L-07 and UVI-L-08 in particular are behavioural: the gate
performs a selection over a synthetic unbounded change and checks that it widened, and
partitions the whole suite at several worker counts and checks that nothing was lost.
A law about behaviour that is checked by reading a docstring is not checked.

    every run would be a false hit. Nothing refused the other omission, and six stages were
    non-reusable with no recorded reason — paying full cost on every run because the
    alternative had never been argued.

    THE ARGUMENT IS THE POINT, NOT THE FLAG. Reading the six reasons is how anyone learns
    whether a sound key is possible at all: the omega gate's subject is the tracked corpus, so
    no key narrower than every file is honest; the coverage report projects THIS run's data,
    so a reused one is wrong rather than stale; registration observation is --full only, where
    UVI-L-09 has already made reuse unreachable. Those are three different reasons and a bare
