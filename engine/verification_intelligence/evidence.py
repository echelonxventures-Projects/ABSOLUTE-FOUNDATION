"""UVI-000001 Part 05 — the Verification Evidence Registry.

A CACHE, and the docstring says so first because everything else follows from it. An
entry records that one declared stage was executed over one exactly-identified input
and passed. It is not a record of truth, it is not evidence of certification, and
deleting the whole store changes no verdict — it only makes the next run pay again.

The key is computed, never asserted. For a stage declaring ``reuse_inputs``, the digest
is taken over the ``content_hash`` values that ``00-MASTER/UCOS-UGA-001/01-EXECUTABLE-
OBJECT-REGISTRY.json`` already publishes for every object under those prefixes, plus the
stage's own identity, the engine version, and THE EXECUTION CONTRACT — the argv
``./verify.sh`` runs under that stage's label. So the question "has this exact stage
already passed over this exact input" is answered from hashes the repository already
owns rather than from a second measurement of the tree.

The execution contract is in the key because without it the question above was answered
for a stage identified only by name. A stage is what it RUNS as much as what it READS:
under EVIDENCE_VERSION 1.0 the label ``universal object birth contract (…)`` keyed the
same entry whether the script ran ``--gate --quiet`` or ``--gate``, so an edit to the
command was answered by a result the edited command had never produced. The argv is
taken from the script's own source text rather than from an expanded process argument
list, which keeps ``"$PY"`` a literal and therefore keeps this machine's absolute venv
path — and any other host detail — out of every key.

Three refusals are structural rather than configurable:

* **A certification-eligible mode never reaches a reuse decision.** ``integration`` and
  ``full`` declare ``evidence_reuse: false``, and :func:`decide` refuses before it looks
  at the store. A certification that reuses a result certifies a cache.
* **An unhashed input is never a hit.** If any object under a declared prefix carries no
  content hash, or the prefix matches no object at all, the digest is refused and the
  stage runs. A cache key that silently covers nothing is a permanent false hit.
* **An unresolvable command is never a hit.** If the script declares the stage's label
  no times or more than once, the contract is unknown, the digest is refused and the
  stage runs. Unknown widens; it never narrows.

    compute a key that omits the command without saying so, which is precisely the
    condition this parameter exists to make impossible: under EVIDENCE_VERSION 1.0 the
