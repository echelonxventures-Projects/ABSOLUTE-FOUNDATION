"""UCOS-CEU-001 Part 04 — the seed catalogue. DATA, and the proof that DATA is enough.

Every concept the steering names — Observer, Perspective, Uncertainty, Possibility,
Pattern, Generation, Recursion, Scale, Temporal model, Unknown, Dependency, Constraint,
Resource, Intent, Purpose, Value, Boundary, Sovereignty, Authority, Contradiction — is
declared here as **data**, and enters the substrate through the ordinary registration
path. Not one of them is a class, a branch, an enum member or a special case.

That is the whole argument of CEU-038 made checkable: if these thirty-odd concepts can be
admitted without a line of new code, then the substrate is *sufficient*, and the next
concept — the one nobody has named — will be admitted the same way. If any of them had
needed code, the substrate would be insufficient and the right response would be to fix
the substrate rather than to special-case the concept.

Every form declares the primitives that express it (:mod:`engine.ceu.sufficiency`), so
"could this have been data?" is answered per row, by measurement, rather than by opinion.

Nothing here is privileged. This file is one catalogue; a deployment may register a
different one, register none, or supersede every row in it. The seeds are examples that
happen to be useful, not a fixed vocabulary.

    authority, so a deployment that wants SI-to-imperial conversions asks for them rather
    than inheriting them.

    Each conversion becomes an ordinary unit of the relationship form (ADR-0005): it is
    identified, journaled, supersedable and evolvable like every other unit, and its terms
    live on the relationship. Nothing here converts anything — the substrate records the
    terms, and a caller that needs the arithmetic does the arithmetic. A conversion needing
    an offset, a context or a provenance carries it without a schema change, which is why
    conversions are relationships and not a table.

    ``conversions`` defaults to :data:`SEED_CONVERSIONS`; pass another tuple to register a
    different set, including between units of a system this file has never named.
