"""UCKP — the Universal Constitutional Knowledge Universe, assembled.

Every layer below this module is a part. This module is the whole: the one place that
puts the law, the registry, the graph, the projections, the persistence adapters, the
execution adapters, the constitutional timeline, the evolution ledger, the intelligence
and the governance runtime together and hands back a single value.

Two design choices are worth stating because they are constitutional, not stylistic.

**Nothing is enumerated.** :func:`build_universe` does not contain a list of the
objects in the universe. It calls
:meth:`engine.uckp.registry.UniversalKnowledgeRegistry.discover`, which walks the
package and admits whatever any module offers through the provider hook. Adding a new
family of constitutional objects therefore means adding a provider module — never
editing this one. That is Article 8, and it is the difference between a universe that
discovers itself and a universe someone maintains a list of.

**The assembled universe is immutable.** :class:`ConstitutionalUniverse` is a frozen
value. Evolving the universe means building a successor and appending a state to the
timeline; it never means mutating the object you are holding (Article 12). The
components inside it — the registry, timeline, ledger and governance engine — are
themselves append-only.
