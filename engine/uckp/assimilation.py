"""UCKP — assimilation of every existing UCOS artifact into canonical objects (Article 19).

Article 19 permits assimilation only on terms: no loss of information, authority,
replay, certification, identity or provenance, and the mapping must be *invertible*.
Invertibility is the demanding half. A mapping that merely copies the fields someone
thought were important is a summary, and a summary silently decides what the future is
allowed to remember.

So each object carries the complete original record, verbatim, in its metadata under
:data:`NATIVE_RECORD_KEY`, encoded through the one canonical form.
:func:`reconstruct_artifact` returns it. :func:`verify_invertible` re-derives every
source record from its object and compares canonical digests, so "lossless" is a
measurement over all 1201 artifacts rather than a design intention.

The salient fields are *also* mapped onto real facets — authority from ``parent``,
dependencies from ``dependencies``, traceability from ``traceability``, evidence from
``content_hash`` and ``path`` — because an object that stored only a blob would be
lossless and useless. The blob guarantees nothing is forgotten; the facets make the
artifact a participating citizen of the graph.

Three things this module refuses to do quietly, because each would be a way of faking
success:

**It does not invent meaning.** All 1201 source artifacts carry an empty
``description``, and 21 names are shared by 490 artifacts (47 files are each called
"Acceptance Decision"). Semantic identity must still be unique or the registry will
refuse the second claimant — correctly, under Article 3. Rather than mangle names or
suppress the collision, :func:`semantic_definition` states what actually distinguishes
them: the native id, the category, the volume and the path. That is a true sentence, and
the collision is reported in the assimilation report rather than absorbed.

**It does not manufacture relationships.** 58 of the 5543 traceability links in the
source registry point at ids the registry does not contain. Those links are preserved
in the native record — nothing is lost — but they are not turned into graph edges,
because an edge to a non-existent object is precisely the dangling relationship
UCKP-INV-04 forbids. They are counted and reported.

**It does not amend the law to fit the data.** The repository's six artifact statuses
(``ACTIVE``, ``COMPLETE``, ``FROZEN``, ``UNDER_REVIEW``, ``FINAL``, ``CERTIFIED``) are
not lifecycle stages the root law declares, and its 70 native categories are not UCKP
governed categories. Both are admitted by *registration* into open vocabularies
(Article 17), which is the mechanism the law provides for exactly this situation. No
line of :mod:`engine.uckp.law` changes because the repository turned out to contain
something it had not enumerated.
