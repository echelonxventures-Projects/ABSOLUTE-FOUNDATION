"""UCKP Layer Zero — the Universal Evolution Model (Article 14).

Evolution observes, learns, reasons, simulates, analyses impact and dependencies,
resolves authority, implements, validates, verifies, replays, certifies, transitions
and assimilates — and then begins again. Article 14 adds three constraints that shape
the whole module: it appends, it never rewrites, and it never terminates.

"Never terminates" is easy to write and easy to violate, so it is encoded rather than
promised. :func:`next_stage` wraps from the last stage back to the first, so there is no
stage from which nothing follows, and :meth:`EvolutionLedger.is_terminated` is a method
that always returns ``False`` because there is no state it could return ``True`` from.
An evolution model with a terminal stage would eventually stop, and a constitution that
stops evolving becomes a description of the past.

"Never rewrites" is enforced by :meth:`EvolutionLedger.append`, which admits only the
stage the cycle says comes next. A caller cannot skip validation to reach certification,
because skipping is exactly how an unproven claim acquires a certificate.

"Never terminates" and "never bounded" are different claims, and the second one also has
to be encoded. :data:`EvolutionStage` is a closed enumeration, so on its own it would fix
the cycle at the fifteen stages that happened to be known when it was written, and a
sixteenth would be a code edit. INV-14 requires that *every* vocabulary admit an unknown
future member, so the stage set is also published as a vocabulary
(:func:`evolution_stage_vocabulary`) — the same treatment
:data:`~engine.uckp.vocabulary.FACET_VOCABULARY_INSTANCE` gives the equally closed
:class:`~engine.uckp.facets.Facet`. The enum remains the single home of the seeded cycle
and the vocabulary is derived from it, so the two cannot disagree; what the vocabulary
adds is that the stage set is now *measured* against INV-14 by
:meth:`~engine.uckp.vocabulary.VocabularyRegistry.is_extensible` instead of being the one
constitutional vocabulary nothing probed.

        Article 14 holds that evolution appends, never rewrites and never terminates.
        Until this method existed that claim was only checkable *inside* the process that
        did the appending: the ledger could project itself to canonical JSON and had no
        inverse, so a published evolution history could be read by a human, diffed by CI
        and trusted by a downstream programme without anything ever re-applying the rules
        it was supposed to have been built under. An append-only history that cannot be
        loaded is an append-only history nobody can falsify.

        Loading is therefore a verification rather than a deserialization. Every record is
        replayed through :meth:`append`, so a history with a skipped stage, a reordered
        stage, a renumbered cycle or an injected record is refused here exactly as it
        would have been refused when it was written — and refused with the same error, from
        the same code path, because there is only one code path. The inverse of a
        content-addressed projection has to be as strict as the projection or the digest
        stops meaning anything.

        ``schema`` is checked because a loader that accepts any object carrying a
        ``records`` array will eventually be handed one that was never a ledger.
        ``cycle_definition`` is checked against the live cycle because a document written
        under a different stage set replays into a different history: the stages would be
        accepted one by one and the whole would silently mean something else. That check is
        what keeps the open-world stage set (Article 17) from turning into a quiet
        reinterpretation of an old history.
