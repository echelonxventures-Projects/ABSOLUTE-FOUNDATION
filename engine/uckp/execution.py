"""UCKP Layer Zero — Universal Execution Abstraction (Article 10).

Article 10 makes two demands. Every execution technology satisfies one identical
contract, and *execution never owns knowledge*.

The second demand is the load-bearing one, and it dictates the design. Every operation
an adapter can perform is resolved by :func:`resolve_operation` — a pure function of the
request and the canonical universe. An adapter's only job is to transport a request to
that resolver and return the result. It follows that swapping Python for Rust, an agent
swarm or a quantum device cannot change an answer, because none of them contains the
answer. If any adapter could produce a different result, knowledge would live in the
runtime, which is precisely what Article 10 forbids.

That is also why the non-Python adapters here are honest rather than pretended. Each
transcribes the request into a language-neutral envelope — the artifact a real Rust, Go,
Java, agent or quantum implementation would receive over a boundary — and returns the
result of the shared resolver. What is proved is that the *contract* is
technology-independent and that the outputs are digest-identical across all ten. What is
not proved, and is not claimed, is that a Rust toolchain is installed: building that
adapter means implementing this contract in Rust, and the envelope plus the expected
output digest is exactly the conformance test it would have to pass.
