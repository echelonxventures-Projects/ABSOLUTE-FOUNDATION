"""UCOS Ω∞ Phase 1, Deliverable 2a — Git, demoted from architecture to provider.

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH).

WHAT CHANGED, AND IT IS ONLY THIS: git is still how this repository is discovered, and it is no
longer how UCOS discovers. The mechanism moved from the middle of the system to behind a contract,
so the sentence "UCOS requires git" became "this provider requires git, and says so".

WHY GIT REMAINS THE PREFERRED PROVIDER HERE, stated so the demotion is not mistaken for a
downgrade. ``platform/tests/test_coverage_scope.py`` records the measurement: a control that
enumerates the working copy decides differently on a developer's machine than on a clean checkout,
and a control whose verdict depends on local debris gets suppressed. Version control is an
ELIGIBILITY BOUNDARY, and that boundary is a real governance property — which is why this provider
declares ``TRACKED_CONTENT`` and carries ``priority = 100``. Resolution by capability then prefers
it automatically, with no call site naming it.

THE ONE BEHAVIOURAL DIFFERENCE FROM Ω-1, AND IT IS DELIBERATE. ``discovery.tracked_python`` asks
git for ``'*.py'``. This provider asks for EVERYTHING and lets the caller narrow with a
``Selector``. The filter was the hard-coded assumption; moving it to the caller is the deliverable.
``compat.py`` demonstrates that passing ``Selector(patterns=("*.py",))`` reproduces the Ω-1
population exactly, so nothing is lost by widening the default.

WHAT THIS PROVIDER DOES NOT DO. It does not classify (Deliverable 4 does), it does not derive
authority (it merely declares that git CAN supply ownership facts, and exposes them on request),
and it does not decide what a knowledge space is (Deliverable 5 does). One question only.
