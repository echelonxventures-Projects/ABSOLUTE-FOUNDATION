"""UCOS Ω∞ Phase 1, Deliverable 6 — capabilities, declared by the provider and never assumed.

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH). This module legislates nothing. It records what a provider says
about itself and refuses to let a caller guess.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. ``engine/universal_discovery/discovery.py`` does not ask whether version
control is available; it runs ``git ls-files`` and raises when that fails. The assumption is
invisible because it is unconditional — there is no place in the code where "is this population
tracked?" is a question, so there is no place where a different answer could be given. A caller
therefore cannot know what it is standing on:

    tracked_python(root)     ← requires git. Nothing says so. Nothing can ask.

An assumption that cannot be interrogated cannot be replaced. Phase 1 makes it interrogable.

WHY CAPABILITIES ARE OPEN AND NOT AN ENUM. An ``Enum`` is a list, and Rule Ω-1 exists because a
list of what exists agrees with itself forever. A provider for a storage system nobody has written
yet will declare a capability nobody has named yet, and that must require no edit here — so
``Capability`` is a value class, the well-known set below is a CONVENIENCE rather than a
constraint, and ``CapabilityRegistry`` admits new names at runtime.

WHY THE WELL-KNOWN SET STILL EXISTS. Two providers that spell the same property differently cannot
be compared, and a capability vocabulary in which every provider invents its own terms is not a
vocabulary. The registry therefore CANONICALISES: a name is registered once with a description,
and a second registration under a conflicting description is refused rather than silently merged.

WHAT A CAPABILITY IS NOT. It is not a permission and not a promise of quality. ``CONTENT_HASHING``
says the provider can produce a content hash, not that the hash is any particular algorithm. A
consumer that needs a specific algorithm asks the provider's ``metadata()``, which is where facts
about a concrete provider belong.
