"""UCOS Ω∞ Phase 1, Deliverable 1 — the DiscoveryProvider contract, registry and resolution.

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH).

THE ASSUMPTION THIS REMOVES, quoted from the code it removes it from::

    # engine/universal_discovery/discovery.py
    subprocess.run(["git", "ls-files", "-z", "--cached", "--exclude-standard", "*.py"], ...)

That line is the entire discovery mechanism of UCOS. It is correct, it is deliberate, and it is a
hard architectural limit: there is no seam at which a different enumeration could be substituted,
so "UCOS governs a git repository of Python" is not a configuration of the system, it IS the
system. Phase 1 introduces the seam.

THE CONTRACT IS FOUR QUESTIONS, and the fourth is the one that makes the other three safe.

  identifier()    a stable name, so evidence can say which provider produced a population
  enumerate()     the artifacts, as universal Artifacts rather than paths
  metadata()      facts about this provider instance — where it is bound, what it is reading
  capabilities()  what it can and cannot do, SELF-DECLARED

WITHOUT ``capabilities()`` THE ABSTRACTION WOULD BE A LIE. A caller holding an interface it cannot
interrogate must assume, and assumption is what Phase 1 exists to delete. With it, "this
measurement requires tracked content" becomes a refusal naming the provider instead of a silent
difference in behaviour between a developer's machine and a clean checkout.

WHAT A PROVIDER IS NOT. It is not a classifier — types come from Deliverable 4, and a provider that
typed its own artifacts would be a second classification path disagreeing with the first. It is not
an authority derivation. It is not a knowledge space. A provider answers exactly one question:
"what is here?"

RESOLUTION IS BY CAPABILITY, NEVER BY NAME. ``resolve_capable(TRACKED_CONTENT)`` is the call a
measurement makes; ``resolve("git")`` exists for evidence and tests. Selecting a provider by name
would re-introduce the assumption one layer up — the code would once again say "git" — which is
precisely the smuggling Rule Ω-1 forbids.
