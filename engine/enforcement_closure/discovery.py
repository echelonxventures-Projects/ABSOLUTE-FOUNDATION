"""UEC-000001 Part 2 — discovery. The enforcement surface, located by rule.

DISCOVERY IS BY RULE, NEVER BY LIST. A hand-written list of gates would be the defect it is
meant to detect: it would agree with itself forever. Every artifact below is located by a
declared rule over the tracked tree, and the declaration's governed inventory is compared
against what the rules find (UEC-L-02 / UEC-L-03). Two independently derived sets, compared —
that is the only shape in which "a gate disappeared" is a computable fact.

VERSION CONTROL IS THE BOUNDARY. ``git ls-files`` decides what exists, not a filesystem walk.
This is the same boundary ``00-BOOK/tools/ukb.py:_repo_artifact_paths`` uses, and it is chosen
for the same reason: an untracked file is not yet a repository artifact, and a gitignored tree
is not part of the repository's answer. Copying the boundary rather than importing it is
deliberate — ``ukb.py`` lives under an ``EXCLUDE_DIR_PREFIXES`` entry, so importing it would
bind the new plane's correctness to a module the old plane cannot see.
