"""UEC-000001 Part 3 — the declaration. Loaded, validated, enforced, reported, certified.

FIVE-STAGE LIFECYCLE, WITH NO SILENT FIELD. Every field this module reads is validated here,
reaches a law in ``contract.py``, appears in the rendered report, and participates in
``digest_payload``. That is not a style preference — it is the direct remedy for a measured
defect. Three declaration documents in this repository (``ceu-declaration.json``,
``urr-declaration.json``, ``ucxi-declaration.json``) have ZERO code consumers, and
``ucon-declaration.json:5`` names ``ucxi-declaration.json`` as its constitutional superior, so
one authority chain in this repository terminates in a document no code reads.
``UEC-L-07``/``UEC-L-13`` measure that class; this module refuses to join it.

DIGEST COMPLETENESS BY INVERSION. ``digest_payload`` returns the WHOLE validated document, with
exclusions enumerated in ``DIGEST_EXCLUSIONS`` and each carrying a stated reason. The opposite
convention — include a chosen projection, document nothing — is what produced the measured
defect in ``engine/construct/declaration.py:550-571``, where ten of eleven keys collapse to bare
identifier lists. Executed against that surface: flipping ``blocking`` on ``UCON-L-01``,
rewriting rule ``UCON-DR-01``'s assigned disposition, and zeroing an evidence floor all leave
``declaration_digest`` at ``192c63af…`` byte-identical, while
``engine/construct/contract.py:1018`` makes the OPEN/CLOSED verdict depend on ``blocking``.

Here the burden is reversed: a field is in the identity unless someone wrote down why not, and
``test_enforcement_closure.py`` proves by mutation that every semantically meaningful edit MOVES
the digest. A test that only asserts a digest is *stable* cannot detect this defect class, which
is exactly what ``engine/tests/unit/test_construct_foundation.py:263-265,922-930`` asserts.
