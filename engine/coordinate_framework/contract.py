"""UCCFA-000001 — the declaration, rehydrated, and the six laws measured over it.

WHY THE LAWS READ FILES RATHER THAN TRUSTING THE DECLARATION. A declaration that asserted its
own correctness would certify nothing: the whole claim of this programme is that every
coordinate it names is one ``01-WORKING/ONTOLOGY-REGISTER.md`` already carries and that its
standing is the standing the ratification record grants. So the register and the supersession
record are read, and a coordinate the register does not carry is refused as invented.

THE TWO SOURCES ARE MEASURED SEPARATELY AND ON PURPOSE. ``UCCFA-L-04`` measures the eight-term
Universal Equation and ``UCCFA-L-06`` the nine dimensions of ``LAW Ω∞-000``; the two differ by
BEING, which is the axiom above reality rather than a term of it. Deriving one from the other
would make a single transcription error unfalsifiable in both.
