"""UCXI-000001 Part 06 — the Universal Context Catalog (DATA).

The fifteen universal contexts *of this platform*, declared once, as data. This is
what makes the layer operational rather than merely definable: a fresh registry can
be bootstrapped to a state in which every universal kind is present, conformant and
provenanced, which is the precondition the certifier measures.

Every value names a **located source** — a repository path or a named instrument that
already exists — so the catalog asserts nothing about the platform that the platform
does not already say about itself. No value is invented for effect; where a dimension
is genuinely open, it carries the explicit ``unknown`` sentinel rather than a
plausible-sounding guess.

Extending the catalog (or replacing it for another deployment) is a data edit: no
consumer of this module branches on a particular kind.
