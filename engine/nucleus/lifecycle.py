"""UCOS-NUC-001 Part 06 — the Universal Autonomous Constitutional Lifecycle (D-18).

AC-008 requires the lifecycle to exist as **infrastructure**, not as documentation,
guidance or process. Repository truth before this module: the lifecycle existed as a
45-node declaration (``UCL-000001``'s stage manifest) plus a script that measured it.
The stages were owned, ordered and acyclic — but nothing *in the importable engine* could
run them over an object, so no nucleus, capability, artifact or context actually executed
the lifecycle.

This module is that missing infrastructure and nothing more:

    * the 45 stages are held as **DATA** (:data:`STAGES`), a checked projection of the
      ``UCL-000001`` manifest. :func:`verify_manifest_alignment` fails closed if the two
      ever diverge, so there is one authority and one verified view — the pattern already
      used for vocabularies — rather than a second, drifting stage list;
    * the execution order is **derived** by the single ordering authority
      (:mod:`engine.foundation.composition.ordering`), never hardcoded;
    * :class:`LifecycleExecution` runs the stages over *any* subject through a caller-
      supplied stage function, records one :class:`StageOutcome` per stage with a
      hash-chained journal, and yields a deterministic, replayable record;
    * a run is a **fixed point** when re-running it reproduces the same digest, which is
      what :meth:`LifecycleExecution.replay` measures.

Nothing here knows what a nucleus is. The lifecycle applies to nuclei, layers,
compositions, capabilities, artifacts, knowledge, registries, policies, evidence,
executions, contexts, universes, civilisations and realities alike, because the subject is
an opaque identifier and the work is the caller's function (AC-008: "everything, no
exceptions").
