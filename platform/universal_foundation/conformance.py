"""UCOS-UFC-001 — Executable conformance against the Universal Foundation Constitution.

The Constitution is only law if it is *measured*. This module measures it: one probe per
declared gate, executed against every Foundation capability the **capability register**
declares, producing a determination in which every verdict is traceable to the article that
demanded it and to the evidence that decided it.

What makes this an honest measurement rather than a status board
---------------------------------------------------------------
Every probe executes a real, deterministic observation over the *live* capability and
records what it observed:

    * contracts are **resolved and version-checked**, not asserted;
    * services are **registered into a fresh registry, validated and resolved**;
    * extension points are **introspected** for abstractness and declared methods;
    * declared catalogues are **read and parsed**;
    * import-time purity is measured by **AST inspection of module-level calls**;
    * determinism is measured by **building twice and comparing fingerprints**;
    * composition is measured by **resolving declared dependencies and the real import graph**;
    * specialisation is measured by **searching module sources for repository locators**.

A probe that cannot execute is a **FAULT**, never a pass. Absence of evidence is never
evidence (UFC-10).

Zero enumeration
----------------
This module names no capability. The population is the register
(``catalog/foundation-capabilities.json``), and UFC-09 is itself measured by proving that no
governing module — this one included — contains any capability identity from that register.
