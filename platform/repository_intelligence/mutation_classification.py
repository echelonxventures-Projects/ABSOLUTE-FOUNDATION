"""EX-016 — the executable classifier for the mutation governance boundary.

``00-BOOK/DATA/mutation-governance-boundary.json`` declares seven ordered classification
rules and a fail-closed terminal. EX-015 made those rules *declarative*; this module makes
them *decidable*. Until a rule is evaluated it is prose, and prose is what let
``uisd-declaration.json`` be authored, owned, engine-consumed and unclassified while six of
its mutations were certified.

THE RULES ARE DATA, NOT CODE. This module contains no rule text, no class name ordering and
no predicate the register does not declare. It loads ``classification_rules.rules``, and
:func:`validate_rule_coverage` refuses **both** directions — a declared rule with no
implemented predicate cannot be evaluated, and an implemented predicate no rule declares is
dead code wearing the appearance of enforcement. That is the same two-sided construction
``engine.infinite_scope.contract.LAW_CHECKS`` and ``ADMISSION_FORMS`` already use.

UNRESOLVED IS NOT A CLASS. It is the declared terminal, it confers no authority, and it must
never be read as a permissive default — a default would silently grant an authority no owner
claimed, which is exactly how CORPUS_REGISTRATION and GOVERNED_DECLARATION each came to be
missing. Consumers that gate on classification MUST treat it as failure.

DETERMINISM. Every predicate is a pure function of ``(subject, Repository)``. The repository
view is built once, from ``git ls-files`` and the registers, and is then immutable: no clock,
no environment, no filesystem traversal order and no dependence on the order in which
subjects are presented.
