"""EC2-TASK-000166 — Runtime Operation Orchestration & Registry (EC2-EPIC-012).

The **record-only orchestration** of governed runtime operations plus the deterministic,
append-only store of the operation records it produces. This is the runtime home of
Program Surface #11 *Runtime Operations* (PC-11): it composes the CERTIFIED-only
admission gate (:mod:`~platform.runtime_operations.guard`) with the read-only EC-1
descriptor façade (:mod:`~platform.runtime_operations.facade`) to *plan* a deploy or
rollback of a certified runtime unit — **generating the EC-1 descriptor by reference and
recording the governed operation**, implementing **no deployment logic of its own** (the
actual runtime execution stays inside EC-1 / the downstream runtime platform).

    * :class:`RuntimeOperationPlan` — the immutable, content-addressed outcome of planning
      one operation: the admitted operation record, its admission decision, and (for a
      rollback) its reversibility proof.
    * :class:`RuntimeOperationPlanner` — the pure orchestration engine. It is fail-closed:
      a non-CERTIFIED (or otherwise inadmissible) unit raises
      :class:`~platform.runtime_operations.errors.RuntimeAdmissionError` and **no
      descriptor is generated and no operation is recorded**.
    * :class:`InspectionEvent` / :class:`RuntimeOperationRegistry` — the append-only
      operation-record store and ordered inspection log (PC-16 audit / reconstruction).

The planner and registry consult no wall-clock and no external state; identical inputs
yield identical plans and identical record ids (P5). Nothing here writes to the certified
corpus (DP-03), and the registry exposes no update or delete of a record (append-only;
descriptive metadata is replaced immutably, preserving the content-addressed id).
