"""UCOS-UOF-001 — Pluggable ownership evidence providers.

Ownership determination consumes *only* constitutional evidence, and every source of that
evidence is a plug-in. A provider observes what a project has declared — an assignment
catalogue, a definitional locator inside a declared home zone, a registration ledger, a
future authority nobody has written yet — and reports findings. It never decides.

The registry is deterministic by construction: providers are ordered by declared
``(precedence, provider_id)``, never by insertion, and a provider that raises is contained
into :class:`~platform.universal_ownership.errors.OwnershipEvidenceError` rather than
allowed to corrupt a determination.
