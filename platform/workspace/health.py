"""EC2-TASK-000088 — Workspace Health (EC2-EPIC-004).

The workspace runtime's **health integration**. It reuses the certified Observability
Layer's health model (:class:`~platform.observability.health.HealthCheck`,
:class:`~platform.observability.contracts.HealthStatus`) — it defines no new health
machinery — and computes a deterministic health probe over the workspace registry and
membership registry. Two critical checks back go-live health (G1) and operational
health under induced fault (OP-C1):

    * ``workspace-registry`` — the registry substrate is reachable.
    * ``workspace-membership-integrity`` — every workspace that has members is a
      registered workspace; an orphaned membership (a fault) drives this check to
      ``UNHEALTHY``, so alerting/health validate under induced fault (OP-C1).

Probing is a pure function of the two registries — no I/O, no wall-clock — so the
health verdict is reproducible (P5).
