"""Verification purity: the verification plane observes and never mutates.

These are the tests that would have caught the defect on day one. `register.sh --guard`
ran the full registration transaction — Phase 1 is `ukb build --mint`, which allocates
permanent Universal IDs — and only *then* checked for drift. Invoked from
`./verify.sh --full`, it minted 140 permanent identities and emitted ~140 PORTAL pages,
taking `artifacts.json` from 1 233 to 1 373 entries, and then failed because the result
was uncommitted. A verification command performed a migration.

Guards, one per way the boundary can be crossed:

* :func:`test_verification_stage_commands_are_observationally_pure` — behavioural. Runs
  each stage command `verify.sh` invokes and asserts the git tree, the identity ledger
  and the lineage ledger are byte-unchanged.
* :func:`test_no_verification_path_invokes_the_minting_flag` — structural. The `--mint`
  token may appear in exactly one invocation in the repository, and it must be
  `register.sh`'s Phase 1.
* :func:`test_corpus_registration_is_a_governed_mutation_class` — declarative. The
  boundary register must name the class, its owner, and `verify.sh` as excluded.
* :func:`test_observation_build_allocates_nothing` — the mint separation itself.

The behavioural test deliberately does NOT run the pytest stage (it would recurse) or
the prerequisite-generation stage (it writes gitignored generated inputs by design, so
it is pure with respect to version control but not to the filesystem).
