"""Tests for the converged canonical-ownership determination and governance reduction.

Two ownership determinations once existed over one population and reported different numbers.
These tests hold the converged determination to the standard that made the convergence
defensible in the first place:

    * it must reproduce the retired determination's measurement, not merely replace it;
    * it must still **refuse to infer**, so the negative cases are load bearing — a change
      that made an unresolved subject resolve would be a regression even though it improves
      the numbers (``CEP-002`` 14.2);
    * a recommendation must never become ownership, at any grain, under any provider.

#: The measurement the retired engine-side resolver produced over this repository. The
#: converged determination must reproduce it exactly; that reproduction is what made retiring
#: the second implementation a convergence rather than a replacement. The pin advances with
#: the measured population: Ω-A12 registered the Foundation's specialisation catalogue as a
#: concept (541 → 542), and the one new concept stands unresolved (390 → 391), so each count
#: moves by exactly its measured amount while declared and contested hold still.
#:
#: CLOSURE-SYNC-001 advances it again for the same reason. UAKOS-CLOSURE-002 now measures 549
#: concepts: the seven UCKO-{ALIAS,EXPLICIT,NOBODY,PEER,TARGET,WRONG,X}-0001 identities carried
#: by engine/tests/knowledge/ukip/test_registry.py — a file tracked since W0-2 and unmodified
#: since — became visible to the concept scan when the upstream model was re-rendered. All
#: seven stand unresolved, so total moves 542 → 549 and unresolved 391 → 398 by exactly the
#: measured population delta, while declared (151) and contested (0) hold still. Those two
#: are the convergence claim: the retired resolver's answer is still reproduced exactly.
#:
#: CLOSURE-HOME-001 advances `declared` for the first time, and the reason it may is that the
#: RESOLVER did not change — the evidence did. This pin compares two implementations of one
#: rule; both read `population_document: 00-MASTER/UAKOS-CLOSURE-002/closure.json`, and the
#: retired resolver, given the input below, would answer identically. What changed is upstream:
#: UAKOS-CLOSURE-002 previously recognised a definitional home ONLY when a file's basename
#: carried the concept id. That fits one of this repository's two id conventions. The other
#: defines a whole family inside one document and declares the range in a heading —
#: `## SECTION 3 — META-RELATIONSHIPS (AMR-01…14)`. Those concepts were homed by evidence zone
#: and never declared, so the determination reported them unowned while their definition sat
#: under a header naming their exact range. Authoring `AMR-01-*.md` to satisfy the old rule
#: would have been a second authoring of existing knowledge, which UCKP-ART-03 voids.
#:
#: 90 concepts hold such a declaration and exactly one document making it, so declared moves
#: 151 → 241 and unresolved 398 → 308 by exactly that amount. The movement is CONSERVED —
#: every concept that moved went from unresolved to declared, and total (549) and contested (0)
#: hold still — which is what distinguishes an evidence delta from a resolver regression. A
#: heading counts only when it declares scope: an id leading its own heading, or falling inside
#: a declared range. An id merely appearing in a heading is a mention, and `## EC3-B10 DATA
#: REALIZATION PACKAGE (ARCH-DATA-001)` is a heading about work on a concept, not a claim to
#: define it — reading those as declarations wrongly moved 51 further concepts, and two such
#: packages then both claimed ARCH-DATA-001. A declaration must also be DELIVERED: SERVICE-005
#: declares `## SECTION 3 — META-RELATIONSHIPS (SMR-01…13)` and carries the thirteen defining
#: rows, while SERVICE-014 cites the same range under `### 15.2 Relationship consistency — all
#: within SOR-01…13 / SMR-01…13` and carries none. Without requiring delivery the two compete
#: and neither can be the home, which is why SMR-01…13 stood unowned beside their definitions.
#: Projections are excluded on the same principle:
#: a document naming another as its `Source:` is a generated view, and UCKP-ART-11 is explicit
#: that generated output never owns truth.
#:
#: CLOSURE-HOME-002 advances it once more, and for the same reason as CLOSURE-HOME-001: the
#: resolver is untouched and the evidence moved. 02-MASTER/EC-3-BAND-REALIZATION-UNIT-REGISTER.md
#: was installed under permit P-UCOS-CORPUS-008 as the definitional home of 47 EC-3 band
#: realization units — concepts that were certified, evidenced under */_evidence/, and owned by
#: no document, because Band 13's charter puts its unit table under "Recommended default WBS ...
#: Recommended, not binding" and a recommendation does not define. declared moves 241 -> 288 and
#: unresolved 308 -> 261 by exactly 47, total (549) and contested (0) hold, and the movement is
#: CONSERVED — every concept that moved went from unresolved to declared, which is what
#: separates an evidence delta from a resolver regression.
