"""UCOS-LEDGER-AUTHORITY-001 — the one identity-ledger write chokepoint.

The defect these tests exist for (D0.1): `uga_engine.py run` printed
``identity ledger updated: 0 minted`` while permanently allocating ``UCOS-OBS-000007``
and advancing the shared ``category_seq``. Nothing miscounted. The run reported from
``epoch1_identity``, which counts ``by_object`` only, while the SAME write persisted the
``by_observation`` identities minted elsewhere. Allocation scope and reporting scope were
different scopes, so a caller-side counter could only ever measure the allocations that
caller happened to know about.

``ledger_authority.commit`` derives the report from the difference between the on-disk
pre-image and the ledger about to be written, so the report is a property of the bytes
rather than of the caller's bookkeeping. These tests hold that property:

* :func:`test_the_authority_is_the_only_ledger_writer` — structural. No tracked source
  outside the authority may name the ledger in a write call.
* :func:`test_an_allocation_can_never_be_reported_as_nothing` — the D0.1 shape itself,
  replayed: a write that allocates only ``by_observation``.
* the append-only refusals — a permanent identifier may not be forgotten, reissued, or
  have its counter rewound.

Every test writes to ``tmp_path``. Nothing here can touch the real ledger.
