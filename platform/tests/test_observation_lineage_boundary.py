"""UCOS-OBSERVATION-UNIVERSE-001 OBS-INV-11 — observation influence, measured differentially.

The defect this pins, measured before the fix
---------------------------------------------
``UCOS-RIB-001`` strips eight declared working-tree measures and recomputes
``gates[].verdict``, ``gate``, ``gate_exit``, ``determination`` and ``compliance`` from
what remains. It never recomputed the AGGREGATES over those verdicts, and they are
computed far upstream at ``rib_engine.py:1939-1945`` from the *runtime* gates, before the
strip runs. The committed artifact therefore stated ``gate: OPEN``, ``gates[]`` all PASS
and ``gates_passed: 10`` in the same file, and five values plus the seal moved with the
working tree:

    metrics.gates_passed · metrics.blocking_failed · metrics.compliance_findings
    metrics.validations_failed · repository.contamination.clean · seal_sha256

Phase 8 held at ``zero_drift_rounds=0`` with ``registry_variance=5`` and
``ordering_variance=5`` while RIB was *perfectly deterministic* — rounds 1 through 5
produced byte-identical digests. The artifact was stable; it was stably wrong, because
the committed bytes were generated over a dirty tree.

Why this test is differential and not lexical
---------------------------------------------
The three guards that existed before — OBS-INV-02 (declared keys), OBS-INV-07 (signature
sweep) and RIB's own ``_WORKING_TREE_MEASURES`` — are the same kind of instrument: a
vocabulary of leak NAMES. None of the six leaking values is spelled like a leak.
``gates_passed`` is a perfectly innocent name for a contaminated number, so every
name-based guard passed while the leak sat in the artifact.

:func:`test_canonical_projection_is_invariant_under_working_tree_state` therefore varies
the observation and compares the output, which is name-free and total over whatever the
producer emits — including the values nobody has thought of yet.

:func:`test_a_non_observation_failure_still_closes_the_gate` is the other half, and is
the one that would catch a "fix" that simply stopped reporting. Nothing may be weakened:
an unclassified ignored path or any other unmet validation must still close the gate.
