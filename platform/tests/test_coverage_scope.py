"""UCOS-COV-SCOPE-001, under Ω-1 — the coverage denominator is DERIVED, and the derivation is total.

WHAT THIS FILE USED TO BE, AND WHY IT WAS NOT ENOUGH.

It governed two hand-written lists. ``addopts`` carried 78 ``--cov=`` flags, ``[tool.coverage.run]
source`` carried 78 paths, and this control refused a disagreement between them or an omission from
both. That was a real improvement over nothing, and it caught real defects. It also had the defect
of its own kind, twice over, and the second time is the one that mattered:

    SOURCE_TREES = ("engine", "platform")

Every question this file asked was scoped by that tuple, so a top-level tree that was neither was
not a possibility the control REFUSED — it was a question the control never ASKED. Five existed.
They carried 35,333 statements and 4,121 passing tests, four of the five had test roots that no
``testpaths`` entry collected, and every test in this file passed throughout. The fix at the time
was to add a second control and a second enumeration predicate, which bought correctness for the
sixth tree and nothing for the seventh.

Then ``_top_level_packages`` was keyed on ``__init__.py``, and ``engine/recursive_knowledge`` — a
PEP 420 namespace directory with sixteen modules, 2,849 statements, a live gate, a ``verify.sh``
stage, a workflow and a 135-test suite — was invisible to it. And ``scripts/``, 281 statements, was
in no list at all and was found by discovery on its first run.

WHAT THIS FILE IS NOW. The lists are gone. ``engine/universal_discovery`` derives the denominator
and the collection set from ``git ls-files '*.py'``, and this control governs the DERIVATION:

  * that it is total — no source package is measured by neither the derivation nor an exemption;
  * that it is honest — no exemption is stale, and every one carries a reason;
  * that it is not vacuous — the specific historical misses are pinned BY NAME, so restoring any
    of the old predicates fails a test that says which defect it reintroduced;
  * and that it is UNBOUNDED, which is the Ω-1 success criterion and is proved by experiment:
    ``test_a_tree_that_does_not_exist_yet_is_already_governed`` builds five top-level trees nobody
    has ever registered and measures that discovery governs all five with zero configuration.

WHAT IS STILL DECLARED, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A REGRESSION. ``[tool.ucos.coverage_scope]``
``excluded_packages`` remains, and must. Ω-5 permits an artifact to sit outside measurement only
under a disposition that STATES a reason; a silent exclusion is the defect and an arguable one is
the remedy. It is a register of judgements, not an enumeration of what exists — which is why a
stale entry is refused in both directions below.
