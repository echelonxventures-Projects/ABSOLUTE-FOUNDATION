"""UCOS-OBSERVATION-UNIVERSE-001 — observation values may not enter canonical identity.

The defect, measured before the fix
-----------------------------------
``00-MASTER/UKAP-001/07-CERTIFICATION-REPORT.md`` sealed a digest of
``00-MASTER/UAKOS-CLOSURE-008/assimilation.json`` that the file did not have, so UKAP
rewrote itself on every run. UCOS-RIB-001, running later in the same UCOS-AEE-001 pass,
observed that ONE dirty entry, flipped GATE-04 and GATE-12, and rewrote sixteen files.
UCOS-AEE-001 then recorded seventeen ``residue`` paths verbatim into ``aee.json`` — the
artifact Phase 8 measures as ``certification_variance``.

A one-file staleness therefore became a twenty-one-file oscillation that could not
converge: Phase 8 measured drift on ``registry_variance`` and ``ordering_variance`` in
every one of five rounds, and zero_drift_rounds stayed at 0.

The amplifier was the defect, not the trigger. UCOS-RC-003 had already established that a
working-tree measurement is a gate input and never canonical identity, and withheld those
VALUES from ``rib.json``. It was correct and incomplete: redaction hides what a field says
but cannot hide whether a list ELEMENT EXISTS, and ``aee.json`` had no such protection at
all.

The regression these tests pin
------------------------------
:func:`test_no_canonical_artifact_embeds_an_observation_value` is the whole invariant:
against the previous implementation it found 169 sites.
:func:`test_residue_is_preserved_as_evidence` is the other half — the reading must still
exist, because the remedy is to RELOCATE evidence out of identity, never to delete it.
