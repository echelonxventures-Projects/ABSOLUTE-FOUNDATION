"""EC2-CAP-SEC-001 / SEC-CLASS — Security Classification contracts (Phase 1).

The versioned contract surface and the immutable **core vocabulary** for the
**Security Classification Runtime** (SEC-CLASS). SEC-CLASS is the constitutional
"enforcement-by-reference seam": it binds the classification records defined by the
four subject-layer security architectures to platform constructs and *records* the
declared enforcement obligation as a **reference** to the existing, certified L7
Identity decision point — it enacts nothing (ARCH-SECURITY-001 §4–§11; DATA-014
DZA-01/03; SERVICE-014 SSE-03; APPLICATION-013 SEC-03/04; INFRASTRUCTURE-013
ISEC-01/04).

This module defines:

    * :class:`ClassificationKind` — the six subject-layer classification record types
      (Authentication / Authorization / Confidentiality / Integrity / Isolation /
      Classification-Label), reused verbatim; no new kind is invented.
    * :class:`SubjectLayer` — the four subject-layer security architectures that own
      the vocabulary, each carrying its constitutional source reference for backward
      traceability (ARCH-SECURITY-001 §14).
    * :class:`EnforcementReference` — an immutable, content-addressed **reference** to
      the L7 seam (a :class:`~platform.identity.contracts.CapabilityGroup` +
      :class:`~platform.foundation.identity.Permission`). It records *what the L7
      point would evaluate*; it performs no authorization (RG-02 / AR-04).
    * the published SEC-CLASS contract surface (:data:`SECURITY_CLASSIFICATION_CONTRACTS`).

All types are **immutable, typed, deterministic, and serializable**, hold no runtime
state, and embed no secret material (SEC-04 / RR-07).
