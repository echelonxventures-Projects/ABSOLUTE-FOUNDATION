"""WP-08 — Admission Key Binder (PRJ-C2 / ACT-C2).

Binds a path-independent **admission key** to a durable P2 identity under an
**admission authority** that owns a namespace and totally orders its own admissions.
It realizes:

    * **AIF-L06 Path-Independent Admission Key** — identity is keyed by
      ``(AuthorityID, local-key)``, decoupled from any path/name (rename stability);
    * **AIF-L07 Authority-Namespaced Uniqueness** — uniqueness by construction; a name
      or key never binds two identities (duplicate detection);
    * **AIF-L09 Authority = Serialization Domain** — one authority totally orders its
      own admissions; under partition it **blocks minting** or **delegates a
      sub-namespace**;
    * **AIF-L14 Atomic Admission** — an artifact exists only when its admission is
      **sealed** *and* its derived projection **re-verifies** (all-or-nothing; a
      failed projection aborts the mint, leaving no orphan identity).

Composition:
    * durable identities are minted through the WP-04
      :class:`~platform.foundation.durable_identity.IdentityRegistry` (prepare/commit/
      abort atomicity is reused directly);
    * authority migration is **witnessed** by the WP-05
      :class:`~platform.foundation.trust.TrustEngine` (a signed successor link),
      keeping already-minted identities immutable while re-homing namespace
      administration to the successor (A/G-AUTH continuity).

Deterministic and stdlib-only; nothing is written to the certified corpus (DP-03).
