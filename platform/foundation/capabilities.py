"""EC2-TASK-000061 — Platform Capability Model (EC2-EPIC-001).

Models the platform's capabilities and, crucially, the **mapping** from each
platform capability to the certified EC-1 engine capability it consumes. This is the
authoritative, machine-readable encoding of the EC-1 ↔ EC-2 boundary declared in the
Program (§2.1/§4.3): the platform exposes capabilities; those backed by the engine
bind to a certified EC-1 capability by contract reference — never by re-implementing
it (additive, no EC-1 modification).

Two capability kinds are modeled:
    * :attr:`CapabilityKind.ENGINE` — a certified EC-1 capability (the 13 capabilities
      the EC-1 Program Closure certified) surfaced through the Execution Layer façade.
    * :attr:`CapabilityKind.PLATFORM` — a platform-native capability (PC-01…PC-18).

The :class:`CapabilityCatalog` is deterministic and validates that every declared
capability dependency resolves; it can order capabilities via the dependency model.
