"""EC2-TASK-000116 — Generation Request Health (EC2-EPIC-007).

The generation-request runtime's **health integration**. It reuses the certified
Observability Layer's health model (:class:`~platform.observability.health.HealthCheck`,
:class:`~platform.observability.contracts.HealthStatus`) — it defines no new health
machinery — and computes a deterministic health probe over the request registry and the
dispatch ledger. Three critical checks back go-live health (G1) and operational health
under induced fault (OP-C1):

    * ``generation-request-registry`` — the registry substrate is reachable.
    * ``generation-request-dispatch-integrity`` — **every dispatched request carries a
      dispatch record** (the "no runtime bypass path" invariant, §7). A request that
      reached DISPATCHED/RUNNING/COMPLETED/FAILED without a recorded dispatch (a fault,
      or a bypass) drives this check to ``UNHEALTHY``, so alerting/health validate under
      induced fault (OP-C1).
    * ``generation-request-execution-integrity`` — every dispatch references a
      registered request; an orphaned dispatch drives this check to ``UNHEALTHY``.

Probing is a pure function of the two registries — no I/O, no wall-clock — so the health
verdict is reproducible (P5).
