"""EC2-TASK-000109 — Generation Request Contracts (EC2-EPIC-007).

The versioned contract surface for the UCOS Platform **Generation Request Runtime**
(L3 Application of the Program architecture, §4) plus the immutable **core vocabulary**
every generation-request service speaks. It reuses the certified EC-1 contract
machinery through the Platform Foundation
(:func:`~platform.foundation.contracts.platform_contract`,
:class:`~platform.foundation.contracts.ContractRef`) and binds request authorization to
the single §3.2 :class:`~platform.identity.contracts.CapabilityGroup`
``generation-requests`` (PC-06/PC-07, matrix index 6) that **already physically exists**
in the certified Identity Layer. EC2-EPIC-007 introduces **no new capability group, no
new authority, and no new authorization logic**.

It also reuses — rather than reinventing — the frozen generation classification model:
the recorded generation ``family`` is one of the six frozen
:class:`~platform.blueprints.contracts.BlueprintFamily` members (the ``05-GENERATION``
Data → Event → API → Workflow → Service → Application chain). The runtime **records**
this classification read-only; it computes none (no alternative classification system,
P10).

Vocabulary:
    * :class:`RequestStatus` — the nine lifecycle states a request occupies
      (``submitted`` → ``validating`` → ``approved`` → ``queued`` → ``dispatched`` →
      ``running`` → ``completed`` / ``failed`` / ``cancelled``); the last three are
      terminal.
    * :class:`ExecutionState` — the derived execution posture of a request (a pure
      function of its lifecycle state): ``pending`` / ``dispatched`` / ``executing`` /
      ``succeeded`` / ``failed`` / ``aborted``.
    * :class:`RequestAction` — the governed request verbs, each mapped to the coarse
      RBAC :class:`~platform.foundation.identity.Permission` it requires.
    * :class:`GenerationRequest` — an immutable, content-addressed request aggregate
      scoped to a parent workspace/project, referencing a catalog blueprint **by
      reference**, carrying identity, ownership, provenance (blueprint ref + submitted
      tick), recorded classification, lifecycle state, and metadata.
    * :data:`GENERATION_REQUEST_CONTRACTS` — the published request service contracts
      consumers (EPIC-008/009/010 dashboards & consoles) bind to by reference
      (PL-05, versioned).

All types are **immutable, typed, deterministic, and serializable**, hold no runtime
state, and hold no secret material (SEC-04).
