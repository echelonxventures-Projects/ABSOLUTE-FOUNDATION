"""EC2-TASK-000091 — Project Registry (EC2-EPIC-005).

The deterministic, append-only store of projects — the runtime home of project
**creation**, **registration**, **discovery**, and **resolution**. A project's
identity is its ``slug`` within its parent ``workspace_id`` (content-addressed
``project_id``), so registration is idempotent-safe and fail-closed on genuine
duplicates. Mutable facets are applied immutably: a lifecycle transition or metadata
update replaces the stored :class:`~platform.projects.contracts.Project` with a new
immutable record (the id is preserved) and records an ordered, append-only
:class:`~platform.projects.lifecycle.ProjectEvent`, so the registry's history is
reproducible and auditable (OP-C3). The registry holds *records only* — it enforces
no authorization (that is the Identity Layer), no isolation (the reused workspace
isolation rule), and it does not resolve the parent workspace (the service binds it);
it is the substrate the project service composes.
