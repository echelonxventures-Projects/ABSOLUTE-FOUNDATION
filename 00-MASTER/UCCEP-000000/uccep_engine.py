"""UCCEP-000000 — Universal Continuous Constitutional Evolution Programme engine.

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH). This engine legislates nothing, registers nothing,
and owns nothing. It is the *aggregation* of gates that already exist and are already
owned, plus the deterministic emission of the programme determinations the mission names.

    python3 00-MASTER/UCCEP-000000/uccep_engine.py                 # observe at the standard tier
    python3 00-MASTER/UCCEP-000000/uccep_engine.py --tier boot     # read-only pass
    python3 00-MASTER/UCCEP-000000/uccep_engine.py --tier full     # every located gate
    python3 00-MASTER/UCCEP-000000/uccep_engine.py --gate          # fail-closed on failure
    python3 00-MASTER/UCCEP-000000/uccep_engine.py --check-declaration
    python3 00-MASTER/UCCEP-000000/uccep_engine.py --check-no-enumeration
    python3 00-MASTER/UCCEP-000000/uccep_engine.py --check-write-scope
    python3 00-MASTER/UCCEP-000000/uccep_engine.py --check-determinism
    python3 00-MASTER/UCCEP-000000/uccep_engine.py --check-observation

OBSERVATION IS NOT EMISSION. Every invocation observes and
renders its verdict. An invocation WRITES only when emission is authorized, and emission
is authorized only when the requested tier is at least as wide as the tier of the
determination Repository Truth already records. A narrower run therefore prints its
verdict and leaves the tracked tree byte-identical — which is what makes the read-only
claim for `--tier boot` above true rather than aspirational. The located authority is
the Universal Observation Law (UEI-CAP-01: "observation is read-only over its subject
and mutates nothing it observes"), declared in the bindings as
`programme.observation_law_owner`.

Narrowing the recorded determination is an explicit constituent act, never a side
effect: `--authorize-emission` is the only path by which a run below the recorded tier
may write, and it announces itself in the run's own output.

Exit semantics of --gate:
    0  every EXECUTED blocking check passed
    1  one or more EXECUTED blocking checks failed
    2  fail-closed abort — the declaration is unusable, so no verdict may be asserted

Standing findings (a PROVISIONAL meta-constitution, a vacant Tier T1, a measured
traceability gap) set the CERTIFICATION CEILING; they do not by themselves fail the
gate. A gate whose verdict cannot be reached in both directions carries no evidentiary
value — that defect is itself recorded as a finding in the declaration.

Stdlib only. No network. No timestamp is emitted anywhere, so the sealed output set is
byte-identical for an unchanged repository state.
