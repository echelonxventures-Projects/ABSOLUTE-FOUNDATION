"""UEI-000001 — Universal Evolution Intelligence engine (UCOS Omega-Infinity Ω∞-001B).

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH). This engine legislates nothing, ratifies nothing,
freezes no architecture and owns no capability. It is the executable expression of the
Evolution Intelligence contract: it reads a single DATA declaration
(``uei-evolution.json``) that binds each mandated evolution capability to the repository
home that already realises it, binds each capability to a located governing instrument,
verifies that every declared home, evidence reference and instrument resolves against
Repository Truth, and computes — never asserts — the coverage, governance, validation,
certification and readiness verdicts.

    python3 00-MASTER/UEI-000001/uei_engine.py                        # regenerate + report
    python3 00-MASTER/UEI-000001/uei_engine.py --gate                  # fail-closed
    python3 00-MASTER/UEI-000001/uei_engine.py --check-declaration
    python3 00-MASTER/UEI-000001/uei_engine.py --check-no-enumeration

    python3 00-MASTER/UEI-000001/uei_engine.py --check-reuse-before-create

Exit semantics of --gate:
    0  the gate is OPEN — every mandated capability is covered by a resolving home, every
       lifecycle step and standing loop is bound to a covered capability, every capability
       carries a governance obligation whose instrument resolves, and every mandatory
       validation and exit criterion is satisfied
    1  the gate is CLOSED — a capability, lifecycle step, loop, governance obligation,
       validation or exit criterion is not satisfied
    2  fail-closed abort — the declaration is unusable, so no verdict may be asserted

The engine contains no capability identifier, no mandate and no validation dimension as a
literal: the evolution contract is DATA. A self-check proves this. Rendering is driven by
a renderer bound per deliverable in the declaration rather than by positional index, so
declaring a further capability — with its deliverable, lifecycle step, validation, exit
criterion and governance obligation — needs no code change.

Stdlib only. No network. No timestamp is emitted anywhere, so the sealed output set is
byte-identical for an unchanged repository state.
