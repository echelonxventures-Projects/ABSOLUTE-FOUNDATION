"""BASELINE-001 — Universal Constitutional Baseline Inheritance.

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH). This engine creates no baseline, advances no baseline,
certifies nothing, ratifies nothing, freezes nothing and occupies no tier. Every baseline it
registers is DISCOVERED by reading the located register that already records it; every
inheritance and non-inheritance rule it binds is a clause it reads out of a located instrument;
every disagreement it finds between the register that records currency and another register
that claims it is reported and referred to the claim owner, never decided here.

The records this measurement reads are append-only. It never writes one: the write set is
proved disjoint from the located record set by --check-record-immutability, which also proves
that every record present in the programme home is a member of the protected set, so a record
cannot be quietly dropped from protection to make room for a generated page.

    python3 00-MASTER/BASELINE-001/baseline_engine.py --render     # regenerate the registers
    python3 00-MASTER/BASELINE-001/baseline_engine.py --gate       # fail-closed baseline gate
    python3 00-MASTER/BASELINE-001/baseline_engine.py --check-declaration
    python3 00-MASTER/BASELINE-001/baseline_engine.py --check-no-enumeration

Exit semantics:
    0  every blocking validation satisfied — gate OPEN
    1  a blocking validation unsatisfied, or a self-guard failed — gate CLOSED
    2  fail-closed abort — the declaration is unusable, so no verdict may be asserted

Every register pointer, scheme pointer, succession reader, release pointer, version source,
lineage source, inheritance rule, non-inheritance rule, scope rule, ceiling, currency claim,
citation surface, record, continuation pointer and validation dimension is read from
baseline-declaration.json. No baseline identifier, no commit identity, no ordinal and no
release identifier appears as a literal below, which is what makes extension an edit to DATA
and to the located records rather than to code.

Stdlib only. No network. No version-control observation. No timestamp, no duration, no commit
identity and no absolute path is emitted, so the sealed output set is byte-identical for an
unchanged repository.
