"""UAKOS-CLOSURE-002 · PHASE-003 — deterministic canonical implementation-planning engine.

PHASE-003 does NOT discover, extract, re-inventory, or rebuild graphs. Discovery is complete
(PHASE-001/002). This engine consumes the FROZEN PHASE-002 baseline as its only authoritative
input and, for every unresolved (unhomed) concept, derives — deterministically and from evidence
only — exactly one implementation strategy: a classification, a canonical destination, an owner,
a dependency chain, an execution wave, a priority, an execution contract, an enrichment plan row,
and a projected closure path. It produces CONSTITUTIONAL PLANS ONLY. It never modifies Repository
Truth, never implements automatically, and never fabricates certainty (fail-closed, TRACK-001).

Authoritative input (frozen, read-only):
    00-MASTER/UAKOS-CLOSURE-002/closure.json   (PHASE-001/002 concept model — the ONLY input)
    00-MASTER/UAKOS-CLOSURE-002/phase2.json    (cross-consistency check)

Outputs (regenerated deterministically): 36..48 NN-*.md + phase3.json

Usage:
    python3 00-MASTER/UAKOS-CLOSURE-002/phase3_engine.py
    python3 00-MASTER/UAKOS-CLOSURE-002/phase3_engine.py --gate   # exit 1 while NOT-CLOSED
