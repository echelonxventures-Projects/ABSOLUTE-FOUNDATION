"""UAKOS-CLOSURE-002 — deterministic repository closure engine.

Implements the Vision-to-Repository closure program as an auditable, re-runnable,
standard-library-only tool (honors UCKO-PRIN-0003 vendor-neutral core and
UCKO-PRIN-0005 determinism). It never mutates the frozen corpus and never issues
a closure certificate that the evidence does not support (fail-closed, TRACK-001).

Pipeline (mission phases 1-10):
    discover sources -> extract canonical concept anchors -> match Repository Truth
    -> assign one disposition -> analyze duplicates/orphans/traceability
    -> emit 14 artifacts + closure.json -> fail-closed determination.

Usage:
    python3 00-MASTER/UAKOS-CLOSURE-002/closure_engine.py            # generate reports
    python3 00-MASTER/UAKOS-CLOSURE-002/closure_engine.py --gate     # exit 1 if NOT-CLOSED
    python3 00-MASTER/UAKOS-CLOSURE-002/closure_engine.py --gate \
        --require-complete-population                     # additionally exit 1 if UNMEASURED

SCAN-MODE DISCLOSURE (AB-6 / CG-10, schema 2).
    The `conversation_only` gap class is measurable ONLY from the external corpus at
    ``REPO.parent / "UCOS"``. Where that directory is absent, no concept originating there
    enters the population at all, so the class measures 0 by ABSENCE rather than by closure.
    Before schema 2 that was indistinguishable, from the outside, from a measured zero: the
    determination is a pure function of the discovered population and never consulted
    ``corpus_present``, so an unscanned population returned CLOSED. This engine's own
    contract above forbids exactly that ("never issues a closure certificate that the
    evidence does not support"), and the repository's standing rule is that a probe which
    cannot execute reports FAULT, never a pass.

    Schema 2 therefore records, on every run and in ``closure.json``:

        ``schema_version``       the disclosure contract version (integer)
        ``scan_mode``            how the population was bounded on this run
        ``population_complete``  False whenever a declared source could not be read
        ``population_disclosure`` the human-readable reason, or None

    Two scan modes are COMPLETE within their declared scope: ``full-corpus`` (the corpus was
    present and scanned) and ``repo-only (declared)`` (the caller set ``CLOSURE_SKIP_CORPUS=1``,
    an explicit constituent act — this is the "declare then use" shape the repository already
    applies to open vocabularies, not "anything goes"). One mode is INCOMPLETE:
    ``repo-only (undeclared — corpus absent)``, where nobody declared a narrower scope and the
    wider one could not be read.

    WHAT THIS CHANGE DOES NOT DO. It does not alter the determination. ``closed`` remains the
    same pure function of the discovered population it has always been, so no verdict moves and
    no gate changes colour. Making an incomplete population BLOCKING is a verdict-changing
    governance act, recorded as AB-6 ("pin canonical full-corpus mode") and reserved to the EKI
    owner pending P2 sign-off; a measurement engine may not confer that on itself. The lever is
    provided, fail-closed and default-off, as ``--require-complete-population`` so the owner can
    bind it in CI with one line at the moment sign-off is given.

    # per id (`APPLICATION-005`, `UCOS-COMP-000000`). The other convention defines a whole
    # family inside one document and says so in a heading: `## SECTION 3 — META-RELATIONSHIPS
    # (AMR-01…14)`. Under the filename rule alone those concepts are homed by evidence zone
    # and never DECLARED, so the ownership determination reported them as unowned while their
    # definition sat under a header naming their exact range. That is a rule whose measurement
    # does not reach it (adr/0041), not an absent definition — and authoring `AMR-01-*.md` to
    # satisfy it would be a second authoring of existing knowledge, which UCKP-ART-03 voids.
    #
    # A heading home is claimed ONLY when exactly one document declares the id. Where several
    # do, the multiplicity is a real competition for someone to resolve, and this engine
    # records nothing rather than picking a winner: choosing between two authored declarations
    # is a determination, and this engine measures.
    # EVIDENCE FILED UNDER A CONCEPT'S OWN DIRECTORY BELONGS TO IT.
    # The scan associates a file with a concept when the file MENTIONS it, which misses the
    # plainest statement of ownership the repository makes: `data/_evidence/EC3-B10-U01/`.
    # Inside that directory, determinism.json and realization-evidence.json happen to repeat
    # the unit id and were credited; validation-evidence.json and validation-report.json do
    # not, and were invisible — so 45 concepts were reported as carrying no validation
    # evidence while their validation reports sat in a directory named after them. The
