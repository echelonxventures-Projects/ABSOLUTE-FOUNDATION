# MCP-005 — MASTER DASHBOARD (UCOS Ω∞)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| ARTIFACT ID | MCP-005 |
| ARTIFACT | Master Dashboard — Operational Metrics, Status & Gates of UCOS Ω∞ |
| CLASSIFICATION | MCS COMPONENT 5 — metrics, status matrix, program gates |
| STATUS | ACTIVE · LIVING · REGENERATED |
| AUTHORITY | **NONE — DERIVED TRUTH.** Reflects live signals; originates no metric. |
| ANSWERS | *How much is done, and is it healthy?* |
| PART OF | Master Context System (`00-MASTER/`), governed by `MCS-000` |
| LIVE SIGNAL SOURCE | `00-BOOK/CONTROL-TOWER/PROGRAM-CONTROL-TOWER.md` + `00-BOOK/DATA/control-tower.json` (regenerate before quoting exact figures) |
| BASELINE | 2026-07-18 · branch `governance-reconciliation` · HEAD `5874ede` |
| CONFLICT RULE | Where any statement conflicts with a higher frozen or governing instrument, the higher instrument governs. |

> **Scope.** MCP-005 reflects metrics/status/gates from the Control Tower and other authoritative signals. It originates no fact: every figure carries its source and capture date. **Staleness discipline:** compare each signal's date/HEAD to current HEAD; treat lag as a risk (see MCP-002 R-CI-STALE), never as truth.
