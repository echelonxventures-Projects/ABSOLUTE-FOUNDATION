"""UAKOS-CLOSURE-009 - Universal Constitutional Assimilation Programme engine.

MISSION
    Project every constitutionally accepted concept already present in Repository
    Truth into a governed Repository Requirement, then MEASURE - never estimate -
    assimilation coverage, lifecycle maturity, readiness, traceability and gap.

AUTHORITY
    NONE - DERIVED TRUTH. This engine creates no constitutional authority, ratifies
    nothing, certifies nothing, freezes nothing and occupies no tier. It measures
    what Repository Truth already declares and writes ONLY inside its own directory.

CONSTITUTIONAL POSTURE
    * REUSE FIRST. Every input is an existing repository register. No re-extraction,
      no re-identification, no fabrication, no new identifier namespace.
    * CREATE = 0 at the concept layer. Requirement identity is a total, injective,
      derived function of the existing concept identity (RR-<CONCEPT-ID>), so no
      independent requirement identity can ever drift from its concept.
    * Zero hard coding. Zone -> program/category/volume classification is read from
      the repository's own configuration (00-BOOK/tools/config.py). Authority is read
      verbatim from the canonical home's own declaration. Unknown zones, unknown
      families and unknown dimensions are carried generically and never rejected,
      so new constitutional object types need no engine change.
    * Zero fixed limits. No family list, no zone list, no dimension list, no lattice
      ceiling and no wave count is bounded by this engine.
    * Deterministic. No timestamps, no randomness, no environment dependence beyond
      the declared inputs; re-rendering is byte-identical at a fixed commit.
    * Replay-stable. A committed artifact can never carry the sha of the commit that
      carries it, so `--render` REPLAYS the head commit recorded in the existing
      requirements.json instead of re-reading it. Without this the registers drift by
      exactly one field on every commit, which is why a byte-for-byte drift gate over
      this programme was previously unenforceable. The mechanism is not invented here:
      it is the pattern 00-MASTER/UKAP-001/corpus_engine.py already proved (Reuse
      Before Create).
    * Fail-closed. `--gate` exits non-zero while constitutional assimilation is below
      100%. `--baseline-gate` exits non-zero while any Phase-8 baseline precondition
      is unproven.
