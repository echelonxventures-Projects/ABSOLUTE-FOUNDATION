# UCOS-UTCE-001 · Lane Obligation and Collection-Mechanism Register

One row per lane of the located lane vocabulary. `labels` are the front-matter row
labels the located relationship vocabulary maps to that lane — the mechanism by which
an artifact can lawfully declare the evidence. A lane with no label cannot be
populated by any means the repository currently provides, and its obligation is
therefore undischargeable until the vocabulary owner adds one.

|---|---|
| `DISCHARGEABLE` | a located label produces this lane; the obligation is met by declaring the row and regenerating |
| `MECHANISM-ABSENT` | no located label produces this lane; the obligation is undischargeable until the vocabulary owner adds one |
