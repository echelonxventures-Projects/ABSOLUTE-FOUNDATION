"""UCOS-RIB-001 — Repository Integration Blueprint engine.

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH). This engine legislates nothing, ratifies nothing,
freezes no architecture and owns no capability. It is the executable expression of
the chartered epic: it reads one DATA declaration (``rib-blueprint.json``) that declares how the
repository is to be DISCOVERED, how each discovered unit is to be MEASURED, which
matrices are already owned elsewhere and must be BOUND rather than restated, and by which
ordered, total rule set exactly one disposition is COMPUTED for every unit — then it
computes, never asserts, the inventory, the capability graph, the dependency planes, the
duplicate and gap registers, the queue, and the twelve gate verdicts.

    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-RIB-001/rib_engine.py                      # regenerate + report
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-RIB-001/rib_engine.py --gate               # fail-closed
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-RIB-001/rib_engine.py --check-declaration
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-RIB-001/rib_engine.py --check-no-enumeration
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-RIB-001/rib_engine.py --check-write-scope
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-RIB-001/rib_engine.py --check-determinism
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-RIB-001/rib_engine.py --check-substrate
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-RIB-001/rib_engine.py --check-no-fabrication
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-RIB-001/rib_engine.py --check-reuse-before-create
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-RIB-001/rib_engine.py --check-totality

Exit semantics of --gate:
    0  every blocking gate passed
    1  a blocking gate failed
    2  fail-closed abort — the declaration or a required substrate is unusable, so no
       verdict may be asserted

The engine contains no unit identifier, no capability name, no disposition name, no
matrix/gate/output identifier and no substrate path as a literal; the blueprint is DATA
and a self-check proves it. Adding a discovery source, a measure, a plane, a disposition,
a rule, a matrix, a gap class, a duplicate class, a gate or an output is an edit to the
declaration and needs no code change.

Stdlib only. No network. No timestamp is emitted anywhere, so the rendered output set is
byte-identical for an unchanged repository state.

    Import-time, not every ``Import`` node reachable in the tree. These edges feed
    ``PLN-CODE`` and ``PLN-MODULE`` — the two planes that decide the acyclicity rule —
    and a cycle is a property of module *initialisation*. Two import forms are
    provably incapable of closing one:

      * ``if TYPE_CHECKING:`` — erased before the interpreter resolves anything;
      * an import inside a function or class body — resolved on first call, by which
        time every module in the loop is already fully initialised.

    This is not a relaxation of the acyclicity rule; it is the rule as the repository's
    canonical owner of the dependency dimension already states it.
    ``platform/repository_intelligence/substrate.py`` separates ``import_time_imports``
    from ``imports`` for exactly this reason, and
    ``platform/repository_intelligence/discovery.py`` records that reading ``imports``
    here "reported both recorded cycles against code that was already decoupled on
    purpose" — naming the ``universal_foundation -> universal_measurement ->
    universal_ownership`` loop closed by a single function-local import in
    ``universal_ownership/cli.py``, which is one of the five this engine reported.

    Counting a deferred import as an import-time edge reports the cure for a circular
    import as the circular import. Measured on this corpus: five ``CYC-ARCHITECTURAL``
    cycles under the every-node rule, zero under this one, while ``PLN-MODULE`` — the
    plane where a true Python import cycle would break execution — reported zero
    non-benign cycles under either. No true cycle is hidden by this rule, because a
    true cycle is by construction made of import-time edges.

    exactly those files again, and each render would disagree with the last over a number
    that describes nothing but the act of rendering. Everything else — an uncommitted
    declaration, engine, README or any file elsewhere in the repository — is retained and
    counted, so the narrowing removes noise without removing dirt.

    Backlog item RB-05 (finding C-5): the per-path LIST is no longer persisted, only the
    counts. That list amplified a scalar condition into ~80 lines of tracked artifact which
    churn with any unrelated repository activity: this model moved +129/-30 -> +137/-30
    across two consecutive audit gate runs solely because an unrelated directory was
    created between them, and the emitted artifact recorded 10 untracked entries while the
    tree already held 11. Persisting a measurement of the working tree's own dirtiness
    inside a TRACKED file is what the repository fixed-point principle forbids -- running
    the gate became a mutation that changed the next measurement. The counts remain, and
    the clean-tree gate and its validation both measure a count, not the list. Every
    offending path stays visible in the gate's stdout report, so nothing is hidden -- only
    the churn surface is removed. Verified before removal: the list was write-only --
    produced here, defaulted in the determinism fixture, read by no code path and rendered
