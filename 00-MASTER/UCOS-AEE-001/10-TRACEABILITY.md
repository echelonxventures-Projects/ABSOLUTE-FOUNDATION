# UCOS-AEE-001 — Traceability

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| PROGRAMME | `UCOS-AEE-001` — Autonomous Evolution Engine v1.0 |
| AUTHORITY | **NONE — DERIVED TRUTH. This programme legislates nothing, registers nothing, certifies nothing and owns no capability. It sequences located owners, reads their sealed determinations, and asserts convergence over what they report.** |
| TIER | `standard` |
| DETERMINATION | **NOT-CONVERGED** |
| SEAL | `4a40807e5a73d0a35f4ee69b335b602b` |
| REPOSITORY ANCHOR | the containing commit — owned by version control, never restated here |

> Every principle to its located enforcing owner, and every located phase to the actuator or observation that discharges it. Nothing in this programme is enforced by prose.

## Principles

| Principle | Statement | Located owner |
|---|---|---|
| `AEE-1` | The loop is closed. Actuation is followed by observation, observation by classification, classification by decision, and the whole by a measured comparison against the previous iteration. A pass that does not compare itself to its predecessor is not an iteration. | `00-MASTER/UEI-000001/uei-evolution.json` |
| `AEE-2` | Zero new authority. Every actuator is a located owner's own entry point and every observation reads a located owner's own sealed output. This programme adds no validator, gate, registry, schema or certification. | `00-MASTER/URRC-000001/urrc_engine.py` |
| `AEE-3` | Zero enumeration. No actuator, observation, mandate, class, decision or owner path appears as a literal in the engine source, so extension is an edit to this declaration alone. | `00-MASTER/UCCEP-000000/uccep-bindings.json` |
| `AEE-4` | Own memory only. Every byte this programme writes lands inside its own operational home. Actuators write their owners' homes because they ARE those owners; this programme writes nobody else's. | `00-MASTER/MCS-000-MASTER-CONTEXT-SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| `AEE-5` | Absence of evidence is never evidence. A required actuator that did not execute, and an observation whose pointer does not resolve, are failures — never silent passes. | `00-CEP/CEP-008-CONSTITUTIONAL-EVIDENCE-TRACEABILITY-CONSTITUTION.md` |
| `AEE-6` | Determinism. The emitted set is a function of the repository alone: no timestamp, no duration, no commit identity and no absolute path is recorded, so regeneration at an unchanged tree is byte-identical. | `00-MASTER/UCOS-RFP-001/rfp-declaration.json` |
| `AEE-7` | Byte-level repository closure is not this programme's to assert. It belongs to the fixed-point owner and is measured by that owner's own gate. | `00-MASTER/UCOS-RFP-001/rfp_engine.py` |
| `AEE-8` | Classification and decision are derived from declared rules over mechanically derived properties of a finding. No finding is classified by hand and none is left without a class and a decision. | `00-MASTER/EVOLUTION-001/EVOLUTION-GOVERNANCE-MODEL.md` |

## Vocabulary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Actuator** | A located, already-owned executable that this programme invokes in order to REGENERATE a sealed determination. An actuator is never authored by this programme and never validates anything on its behalf. |
| **Observation** | A single measured reading taken from a located owner's own sealed output, addressed by a dotted pointer and compared against a declared expectation by a generic operator. An observation performs no analysis of its own; it reports what its owner already determined. |
| **Observation vector** | The ordered tuple of every observation's measured verdict in one iteration. It is the object over which this programme asserts a fixed point. |
| **Finding** | An observation whose measured value violates its declared expectation. A finding is discovered, never listed by hand: the set of findings is a function of the located owners' sealed outputs. |
| **Mandate** | A loop phase or standing obligation READ from a located declaration that already owns it. Mandates are never restated in this file. |
| **Iteration** | One complete pass of actuation followed by observation, classification and decision. |
| **Convergence** | The state in which consecutive iterations produce an identical observation vector and every blocking criterion is satisfied. Convergence is measured, never asserted. |
| **Residue** | A working-tree entry appearing during an iteration. Residue is ATTRIBUTED to the actuator whose declared write zone contains it; residue that no declared write zone explains is unattributed and blocks convergence. |
| **Learning** | The deterministic persistence of what an iteration established — measured values, exercised write zones, assigned classes and decisions, and the iteration at which stability was reached — so a later run resolves an identical finding by lookup instead of rediscovery. It is a knowledge projection, not a statistical model. |
| **Certification ceiling** | A standing, located finding that bounds the verdict this programme may assert without itself failing the gate. A ceiling is disclosed; it is never silently dropped. |
