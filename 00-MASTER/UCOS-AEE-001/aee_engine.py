"""UCOS-AEE-001 — Autonomous Evolution Engine.

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH). This engine legislates nothing, registers nothing,
certifies nothing and owns no capability. Every phase of the evolution loop already has a
located owner in this repository; this engine creates none of them. What no located
programme owned is the CLOSED LOOP itself — every entry point here is a one-shot process,
so nothing re-executed the located owners, re-read their sealed determinations, compared
consecutive readings and asserted a fixed point over what they report. This engine is that
driver and only that driver.

    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-AEE-001/aee_engine.py --tier observe   # read-only, no actuation
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-AEE-001/aee_engine.py                  # actuate + converge
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-AEE-001/aee_engine.py --tier closure   # include the heavy tier
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-AEE-001/aee_engine.py --gate           # fail-closed
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-AEE-001/aee_engine.py --check-declaration
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-AEE-001/aee_engine.py --check-no-enumeration

    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-AEE-001/aee_engine.py --check-mandate-coverage

Exit semantics:
    0  the loop converged and every blocking criterion is satisfied
    1  a blocking convergence criterion is unsatisfied
    2  fail-closed abort — the declaration is unusable, so no verdict may be asserted

Every actuator, observation, mandate, class, decision, rule and criterion is read from
aee-declaration.json. No identifier this engine acts on appears as a literal below, which
is what makes extension an edit to DATA rather than to code.

Stdlib only. No network. No timestamp, no duration, no commit identity and no absolute
path is emitted, so the sealed output set is byte-identical for an unchanged repository.

#: UCOS-OBSERVATION-UNIVERSE-001 — observation VALUES may not enter canonical identity.
#:
#: `residue` is the set of paths whose on-disk state changed while a located actuator ran.
#: It is Observation Truth: it depends on what the working tree held BEFORE the run, not on
#: what the commit contains. Writing it into aee.json — the artifact Phase 8 measures as
#: `certification_variance` — made this programme's canonical identity a function of the
#: tree it was measuring.
#:
#: Measured: one stale digest in UKAP-001 caused ONE file to be rewritten. RIB, running
#: later in the same pass, observed that single dirty entry, flipped GATE-04 and GATE-12
#: and rewrote sixteen files. This engine then recorded seventeen residue paths into
#: aee.json. A one-file staleness became a twenty-one-file oscillation that could not
#: converge, because running the gate was itself a mutation that changed the next reading.
#:
#: NOTHING IS WEAKENED AND NOTHING IS DELETED. Residue is still computed, still drives
#: `unattributed`, still fails the write-zone finding closed, and still appears in the
#: dashboard and the evidence index. Only its SERIALIZATION into canonical identity is
#: replaced — by the observation's stable Universal Identity, which is keyed on
#: observer::subject::kind and therefore never moves when the reading does. The reading
#: itself is written to the evidence surface below, so it remains fully traceable.
#:
#: This is the RIB UCOS-RC-003 pattern, applied to the one programme that lacked it, and
#: extended past the flaw RC-003 left open: redaction can hide what a field SAYS, but not
#: whether a list ELEMENT EXISTS, so the key is replaced rather than blanked.
