# UCOS-AEE-001 — Certification Report

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| PROGRAMME | `UCOS-AEE-001` — Autonomous Evolution Engine v1.0 |
| AUTHORITY | **NONE — DERIVED TRUTH. This programme legislates nothing, registers nothing, certifies nothing and owns no capability. It sequences located owners, reads their sealed determinations, and asserts convergence over what they report.** |
| TIER | `standard` |
| DETERMINATION | **NOT-CONVERGED** |
| SEAL | `44cb9736cf27e08d824ac627fa2a9d6f` |
| REPOSITORY ANCHOR | the containing commit — owned by version control, never restated here |

> What this programme certifies, and — equally — what it does not. A verdict that could not be reached in both directions would carry no evidentiary value.

## Certified

| Subject | Evidence | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| The loop is closed and its convergence is measured | `06-ITERATION-LEDGER.md` · `07-CONVERGENCE-CERTIFICATION.md` | NOT-CONVERGED |
| Every actuator is a located owner, none authored here | `02-ACTUATOR-EXECUTION-REGISTER.md` · `--check-reuse-before-create` | CERTIFIED |
| Every reading comes from a located owner's sealed output | `03-OBSERVATION-REGISTER.md` | CERTIFIED |
| Every loop phase is read, not restated | `01-MANDATE-COVERAGE-REGISTER.md` · `--check-mandate-coverage` | CERTIFIED |
| Every finding carries a class, a decision and located evidence | `05-DECISION-REGISTER.md` | CERTIFIED |
| Emission is deterministic | `--check-determinism` | CERTIFIED |

## Not certified here, and by whom instead

| Subject | Located owner | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| A certification ceiling stands: the aggregate certifier reports standing located findings | `00-MASTER/UCCEP-000000/uccep-bindings.json` | The ceiling is a union: one component is a measured traceability gap owned by a located work package, the other is a vacancy of ratifying authority. The vacancy cannot be closed by any act inside this repository, so the composite ceiling is not engineering-closable and this programme discloses it instead of asserting an unqualified verdict. |
| Convergence here is over the observation vector, not over the repository's bytes | `00-MASTER/UCOS-RFP-001/rfp-declaration.json` | Byte-level closure requires a clean committed tree to begin and runs the aggregate certifier as one of its own stages. A driver that emits artifacts cannot assert cleanliness over itself, and invoking the fixed-point engine from here would rebuild the recursion topology that engine exists to forbid. The condition is not weakened, only owned elsewhere and measured by its own gate. |
| Cadence is bound to continuous integration, not to a resident process | `.github/workflows/aee-gate.yml` | No resident process, scheduler or armed session hook exists anywhere in this repository, and the hooks that did exist were deliberately disarmed. A daemon would be unadjudicated surface. The loop therefore runs on every push and on operator invocation, which is the cadence authority the repository actually has. |
