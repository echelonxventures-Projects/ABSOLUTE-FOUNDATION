"""Author 00-MASTER/URKE-000001/urke-declaration.json — the data this capability is made of.

The declaration is the artifact of record; this script is how it is written, kept beside it so a
reader can see the shape being asserted instead of reverse-engineering it. Running it is idempotent.

The shape is the final convergence: **two structural primitives** (a subject and a relationship),
**seven lifecycle states**, and everything else data. Forty-one states and twenty-six unknown classes
were drafted for this capability and collapsed; every condition they named survives as a row in the
condition catalogue, expressed as one state plus axis values plus qualifiers plus a domain. Nothing
lost, nothing hardcoded — and both halves of that sentence are measured rather than asserted, by
URKE-L-30 (every catalogued condition is realised on every run) and URKE-L-32 (the primitive count
has not drifted upward while the data grew).
