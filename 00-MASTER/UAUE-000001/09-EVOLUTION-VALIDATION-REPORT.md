## Declared criteria

| Criterion | Subject | Obligation | Blocking |
|---|---|---|---|
| AUE-VAL-01 | Correctness | every evolution object's identity equals the digest of its own declared identity inputs | PASS |
| AUE-VAL-02 | Completeness | every evolution object carries every mandated field, and every field declared non-empty is non-empty | PASS |
| AUE-VAL-03 | Consistency | every canonical stage of the evolution cycle is claimed by exactly one phase, and every phase produces exactly one object kind | PASS |
| AUE-VAL-04 | Compatibility | every declared owner home resolves in repository truth and every declared symbol is bound in it | PASS |
| AUE-VAL-05 | Traceability | every candidate resolves to a discovery source that exists, and every mandated object kind is produced | PASS |
| AUE-VAL-06 | Reproducibility | two renders of one declaration over one repository state are byte-identical | PASS |
