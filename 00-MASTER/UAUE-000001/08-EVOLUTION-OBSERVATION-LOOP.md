*expected result, actual result and deviation, attributed to the owner that measured it*

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| position | AUE-P-06 — Measure |
| duty | observe the result after execution and compare expected against actual, recording the deviation |
| produces | AUE-OBJ-06 — Evolution Observation Object |
| canonical stages | replay |
| gate | `make aee-gate` (PASS) |
| authority | UCOS-CTRL-000001 — the universal control plane, which owns delta classification against declared orderings |
| classification | IMPLEMENTED |

**Reuse basis.** The control-plane evolution engine already classifies a delta as promoted, regressed, improved, modified or unchanged against declared orderings. Measurement reuses that classification instead of inventing a verdict word.
