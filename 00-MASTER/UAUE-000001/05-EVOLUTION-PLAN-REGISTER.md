*objectives, steps, dependencies, risk, the criteria each later phase is judged against, and rollback*

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| position | AUE-P-03 — Plan |
| duty | produce objectives, steps, dependencies, risk, acceptance criteria and a rollback strategy under the governing authority |
| produces | AUE-OBJ-03 — Evolution Plan Object |
| canonical stages | reason, authority-resolution |
| gate | `make uaep-gate` (PASS) |
| authority | URI-000001 — the realization planning authority, with the assurance policy as the obligation source |
| classification | IMPLEMENTED |

**Reuse basis.** Three planners already exist — realization waves, assurance obligations and the execution plan the mutation gateway certifies against. No fourth planner is written; the plan object records which of them governs each step.
