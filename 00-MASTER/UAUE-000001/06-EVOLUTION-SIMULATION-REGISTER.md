*impact prediction, dependency validation and risk evaluation obtained before any execution*

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| position | AUE-P-04 — Simulate |
| duty | predict impact, validate dependencies and evaluate risk before anything is executed |
| produces | AUE-OBJ-04 — Evolution Simulation Object |
| canonical stages | simulate |
| gate | `make final-closure-gate` (PASS) |
| authority | engine/uckp/law.py UCKP-ART-13 — replay is the only impact prediction that can be verified rather than believed |
| classification | IMPLEMENTED |

**Reuse basis.** Simulation is replay against a candidate state rather than a new predictive engine: the replay owners already prove that executing a plan twice reaches one digest, which is the only impact prediction that can be verified rather than believed.
