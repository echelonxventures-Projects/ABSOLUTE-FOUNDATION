# 01 — WAVE 1 CONTEXT ASSIMILATION

**Mission:** UCOS Ω∞ Wave 1 Context Assimilation Gate (READ • ANALYZE • PLAN • AUTHORIZE — **no implementation**)
**Baseline:** `origin/governance-reconciliation` @ `2bf5312`, tag `UCOS-BASELINE-2bf5312`
**Nature:** Read-only. No repository modification, no commits, no generation. Outputs are operational memory under `00-MASTER/` (excluded from the corpus scan; not registered; not committed).

## 1 — Assimilated repository state (published, verified)

| Fact | Value | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical branch / HEAD | `governance-reconciliation` @ `2bf5312` | `git rev-parse`, `git ls-remote` (local == remote) |
| Baseline tag | `UCOS-BASELINE-2bf5312` | remote tag verified |
| Registered artifacts | **1002** | `ukb stats` / `ukb enforce` |
| Programs | 30+ families incl. RUN, PLATFORM, DATA, SERVICE, APPLICATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, SECURITY, **USIS** | `config.py`, control tower |
| Volumes | 25 total / 23 active; USIS = **VOL-024** | `00-BOOK/DATA/volumes.json` |
| Graph | 11,839 edges, acyclic | `ukbx twin --check` (C-07) |
| Drift | **zero** — `register.sh --guard` PASS | guard exit 0 |
| Determinism | guard-scope SHA-256 `9be632c1…`, byte-stable | 3 identical regenerations |
| Certification | `ukbx certify` 10/10 integrity domains | `certification.json` |

**Wave 0 outcome:** USIS established as a first-class constitutional program at the
**PROVISIONAL / engineering-authority tier**. Root artifact `USIS-GOV-000`
(`UCOS-USIS-000001`) registered under `15-UNIVERSAL-SCIENCE-INTELLIGENCE/`;
FREEZE C4 (7-stream model) CERTIFIED (`710769fc…`); C2/C3 immutable.

## 2 — What Wave 1 actually is

**Authoritative source: `USIS-012` Implementation Roadmap.**

> **Wave 1 — Substrate Foundation (USIS-001…005):** Constitution → Universe
> Catalog → Science Catalog → Meta-Model → Theory/Ontology/Taxonomy. Establishes
> the substrate hypergraph and the meta-model spine. Each capability authored,
> classified, registered, and certified under UCIC-001.

Downstream (context only, **not** this authorization): Wave 2 = architecture
spine (USIS-006…017); Wave 3 = universe & science realization; Wave 4 =
Self-Evolution; Wave 5 = runtime/validation/certification/observability; Wave 6 =
continuous future expansion (FREEZE C5).

### 2.1 — Scope-term reconciliation (flagged, not fabricated)

The Wave-0 completion/readiness determinations refer to Wave 1 as
"USIS-001…**021** substrate/architecture realization." The roadmap (`USIS-012`)
scopes the **immediate** Wave 1 to **USIS-001…005** and distributes USIS-006…021
across Waves 2–6. These are consistent (the former is shorthand for the whole
realization program). **This gate plans Wave 1 = USIS-001…005** and defers
006…021 to their roadmap waves. The authorizer should confirm this boundary
(see `05` — Risk R-3).

## 3 — Constitutional constraints (binding on every Wave 1 artifact)

From `USIS-001` Program Constitution (subordinate to LAW Ω∞-000, MIP Parts
19/20/21/25/22/32) and `USIS-011`:

- **LAW USIS-00 / -03** — integration by **registration, never redesign**; adding a science/domain/capability is append-only.
- **LAW USIS-02** — **realization, not duplication**; USIS realizes universes U16/U24/U25/U26/U28 + Parts 19/20/21 and SHALL NOT create a competing catalog/ontology/taxonomy/registry where a canonical one exists (Reuse-First).
- **LAW USIS-04** — **technology neutrality**; no vendor/cloud/framework/model/language/DB/algorithm named in architecture (registered content only).
- **LAW USIS-05** — **canonical ownership / No-Orphan** (GOV-001-T3): one home, one owning family, zero orphans.
- **LAW USIS-06** — **governed autonomy**; self-* is simulate-then-adopt and reversible (applies from Wave 4, constrains Wave 1 catalog/meta-model design).
- **LAW USIS-07** — **explainable provenance**; every inference/decision/learned-change emits a trace (absence ⇒ NOT-DONE, TRACK-001).
- **LAW USIS-08** — **meta-model conformance** to USIS-004 end-to-end.
- **LAW USIS-09** — **recursive extensibility**; open, no compiled ceiling.
- **Part F invariants (fail-closed, all must be 0):** duplicate universe/catalog/ontology/taxonomy/registry; hard-coded tech; orphans; closed/finite registries; freeze edits; capability without governing determination + anchor + 7 integration facets; dependency cycles.
- **Frozen-path prohibition:** Wave 1 authors **only** under `15-UNIVERSAL-SCIENCE-INTELLIGENCE/`. It must not edit `engine/**`, `platform/**`, `00-SOURCE/**`, `99-FREEZE/**`, `00-BOOK/**` — the sole permitted governed source touch is an **append-only** `config.py` edit (see `04` — Phase W1-0).
- **Higher-instrument supremacy:** any conflict is resolved in favor of the higher frozen/governing instrument; the artifact is void to the extent of conflict.

## 4 — Execution model (inherited, reused)

Every USIS capability is realized under **UCIC-001** — a 15-stage, fail-closed
governed execution model — plus the **SCIENCE_INTELLIGENCE lifecycle**
(USIS-008): DEFINED → GROUNDED → MODELED → REASONED → VALIDATED → CERTIFIED →
EVOLVING. Per-capability mandatory structure (USIS-001 Part D) must be specified
before Stage 4: Identifier · Objective · Dependencies · Governing Determination ·
Constitutional Anchor · Additive Surfaces · Acceptance · Evidence · Validation ·
Certification · Required Repo Updates · Completion Definition.

## 5 — Existing governance assets (present, reusable)

- **Determinations/laws:** LAW Ω∞-000; UCIC-001; GOV-001-T3 (No-Orphan); GOV-002 (traceability); REG-AUTO-001 (registration); CEP-006 (PROVISIONAL tier); FREEZE C2/C3 (immutable) + C4 (certified 7-stream).
- **USIS establishment package (14 artifacts, operational memory `00-MASTER/UCOS-USIS-001/`):** constitution, universe catalog (21), science catalog (30 seed), meta-model (24-tier), structure spec (21 areas), domain/human-intelligence catalog (42 + 38), data/analytics/self-evolution universes (24 self-*), execution-stream proposal, registry manifest (12 registries), properties certification (21), proof-obligations register (21), roadmap, completion report. These are the **authoritative blueprints** Wave 1 realizes into registered corpus.
- **CI backstop:** `.github/workflows/ucos-registration-gate.yml` runs `register.sh` (pre/post enforce + drift guard) on every push/PR with Python 3.12 and `pip install jsonschema` (so schema validation is exercised in CI even though absent locally).

## 6 — Wave-1 entry preconditions (Wave-0 readiness ledger, re-evaluated at 2bf5312)

The `06-WAVE1-READINESS` ledger (authored during Wave 0) is now **discharged**:

| Precondition | Wave-0 state | State @ `2bf5312` | Evidence |
|---|:--:|:--:|---|
| Wave 0 (0.1–0.4) executed | ✅ | ✅ | Wave-0 Completion Determination |
| Baseline certified | ❌ | ✅ | Projection convergence CONVERGED; `ukbx certify` 10/10 |
| USIS `VOL` unique | ❌ (VOL-023 collision) | ✅ **VOL-024** | `volumes.json`, `config.py:275` |
| FREEZE C4 certified | ✅ | ✅ | seal `710769fc…` |
| USIS root registered/classified/homed | ✅ | ✅ | `UCOS-USIS-000001`, 0 orphans |
| Baseline committed | ❌ | ✅ | commit `2bf5312` |
| Baseline published | (n/a) | ✅ | remote == local; tag present |
| DR-RAT-11 constitutional finality | external | external, **non-blocking** | PROVISIONAL tier standing |
| **Explicit Wave-1 authorization** | ❌ | ❌ **(by design — next step)** | this gate |

Every readiness precondition except the explicit human "go" is satisfied. See
`05` for the determination.
