## PREAMBLE

This constitutional instrument establishes the Universal Authority Interaction Security Model — the canonical framework for securing interactions between authorities in UCOS Ω∞.

**Security defines:**
- Authentication mechanisms
- Authorization models
- Security evidence requirements
- Threat models
- Security proofs

**Critical Principle:**

Security is **verification of claims**, not **evaluation of trustworthiness**.

```
Security ≠ Trust
Security ≠ Authorization (Security enables authorization)
Security ≠ Identity (Security verifies identity)
Security ≠ Discovery (Security validates discovered authorities)
```

**Separation of Concerns:**

```
Authentication    = Proving identity claims
Authorization     = Deciding what is permitted
Trust             = Evaluating reliability
Identity          = Canonical existence
Discovery         = Finding authorities
Conflict          = Resolving contradictions
```

### 1.2 Core Concepts

**Authentication:**
The process of verifying that an authority's claimed identity matches its actual identity.

**Authorization:**
The process of determining whether an authenticated authority is permitted to perform a requested action.

**Security Evidence:**
Immutable records proving that security requirements were satisfied.

**Threat Model:**
A systematic enumeration of security threats and required mitigations.

**Security Proof:**
Formal or cryptographic evidence that a security property holds.

**Security Boundary:**
The explicit scope of what security mechanisms protect and what they do not protect.

---

## SECTION 2: AUTHENTICATION MODEL

### 2.1 Authentication Principles

**Principle 1: Identity Separation**

Authentication verifies identity claims. Authentication does NOT define identity.

```
Identity Definition      → CMG-000006 (Authority Identity Model)
Identity Verification   → CMG-000008 (This document)
```

**Principle 2: Multiple Authentication Methods**

No single authentication method is universally applicable.

Different contexts require different authentication mechanisms:
- Cryptographic contexts: Public key authentication
- Lineage contexts: Chain of custody authentication
- Evidence contexts: Historical record authentication
- Physical contexts: Biometric or physical token authentication

**Principle 3: Authentication Evidence**

Every authentication attempt MUST generate evidence, regardless of success or failure.

Evidence types:
- Challenge evidence (what was asked)
- Response evidence (what was provided)
- Verification evidence (verification result)
- Temporal evidence (when verification occurred)

### 2.2 Authentication Methods

## SECTION 3: AUTHORIZATION MODEL

### 3.1 Authorization Principles

**Principle 1: Authorization Follows Authentication**

Authorization decisions REQUIRE successful authentication.

```
Authentication → Authorization → Action
```

**Principle 2: Authorization ≠ Trust**

Authorization is **permission**, not **trustworthiness evaluation**.

```
Authorization Decision → CMG-000008 (This document)
Trust Evaluation       → CMG-000010 (Trust Evolution Model)
```

**Principle 3: Least Privilege**

Authorize only the minimum required access.

**Principle 4: Explicit Authorization**

Default deny. All permissions must be explicitly granted.

**Principle 5: Temporal Bounds**

All authorizations have temporal validity bounds.

### 3.2 Authorization Types

## SECTION 6: CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS

### Law 1: Authentication Precedence

**Statement:**
Authentication MUST succeed before authorization is evaluated.

**Formal:**
```
∀ interaction I:
  authorize(I) → authenticate(I) = SUCCESS
```

**Proof:**
Authorization decisions require knowing the authority identity. Identity verification requires authentication. Therefore, authentication must precede authorization.

### Law 2: Security Evidence Immutability

**Statement:**
All security evidence MUST be immutable and preserved per CMG-000011.

**Formal:**
```
∀ security_evidence E:
  E ∈ Evidence_Model(CMG-000011)
  ∧ immutable(E) = TRUE
  ∧ preserved(E) = TRUE
```

**Proof:**
Security decisions rely on evidence. Mutable evidence enables evidence tampering. Therefore, security evidence must be immutable.

### Law 3: Explicit Authorization

**Statement:**
All authorizations MUST be explicitly granted. Default is deny.

**Formal:**
```
∀ action A, authority X:
  authorized(X, A) ↔ ∃ explicit_grant(X, A)
  ¬∃ explicit_grant(X, A) → ¬authorized(X, A)
```

**Proof:**
Implicit authorization creates security vulnerabilities. Explicit authorization provides clear evidence of permission grants. Therefore, all authorizations must be explicit.

### Law 4: Temporal Authorization Bounds

**Statement:**
All authorizations MUST have temporal validity bounds.

**Formal:**
```
∀ authorization Z:
  ∃ t_start, t_end ∈ TemporalCoordinates(CMG-000002):
    valid(Z, t) ↔ t_start ≤ t ≤ t_end
```

**Proof:**
Unbounded authorizations create long-term security risks. Temporal bounds enable authorization revocation and evolution. Therefore, all authorizations must have temporal bounds.

### Law 5: Security Separation

**Statement:**
Security, Trust, Identity, Discovery, and Conflict Resolution are distinct concerns.

**Formal:**
```
Security ≠ Trust
Security ≠ Identity
Security ≠ Discovery
Security ≠ Conflict

Security(Authentication ∪ Authorization) ∩ Trust = ∅
```

**Proof:**
Security verifies claims. Trust evaluates reliability. Identity defines existence. Discovery finds authorities. Conflict resolves contradictions. These concerns have different purposes, different inputs, and different outputs. Therefore, they are distinct.

### Law 6: Authentication Evidence Completeness

**Statement:**
Authentication evidence MUST include challenge, response, verification result, and temporal coordinate.

**Formal:**
```
∀ authentication_evidence E:
  complete(E) ↔ (challenge(E) ∧ response(E)
                 ∧ verification_result(E) ∧ temporal(E))
```

**Proof:**
Authentication verification requires challenge context, response data, verification result, and temporal context. Missing any element prevents authentication verification. Therefore, authentication evidence must be complete.

### Law 7: Authorization Evidence Completeness

**Statement:**
Authorization evidence MUST include request, evaluation process, decision, rationale, and temporal coordinate.

**Formal:**
```
∀ authorization_evidence E:
  complete(E) ↔ (request(E) ∧ evaluation(E)
                 ∧ decision(E) ∧ rationale(E) ∧ temporal(E))
```

**Proof:**
Authorization audit requires request details, evaluation process, decision result, decision rationale, and temporal context. Missing any element prevents authorization audit. Therefore, authorization evidence must be complete.

### Law 8: Least Privilege

**Statement:**
Authorizations MUST grant minimum required permissions.

**Formal:**
```
∀ authorization Z, permissions P:
  granted(Z) = min_required(P)
```

**Proof:**
Excessive permissions increase attack surface. Minimal permissions minimize security risk. Therefore, authorizations must follow least privilege principle.

### Law 9: Security Threat Mitigation

**Statement:**
All identified threat classes MUST have specified mitigations.

**Formal:**
```
∀ threat T ∈ ThreatModel:
  ∃ mitigation M: mitigates(M, T)
```

**Proof:**
Unmitigated threats create security vulnerabilities. Specified mitigations enable security validation. Therefore, all threats must have mitigations.

### Law 10: Authentication Method Diversity

**Statement:**
Multiple authentication methods MUST be supported for different contexts.

**Formal:**
```
|AuthenticationMethods| ≥ 4
∧ cryptographic_auth ∈ AuthenticationMethods
∧ evidence_auth ∈ AuthenticationMethods
∧ lineage_auth ∈ AuthenticationMethods
∧ multi_factor_auth ∈ AuthenticationMethods
```

**Proof:**
Different contexts require different authentication mechanisms. Single authentication method creates single point of failure. Therefore, multiple authentication methods must be supported.
