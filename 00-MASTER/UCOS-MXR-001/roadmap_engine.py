"""UCOS-MXR-001 — deterministic master execution roadmap engine (post UAKOS-CLOSURE-008).

Discovery, extraction, verification, reconciliation and closure are COMPLETE and are NOT
repeated here. This engine performs no discovery, mines no conversation corpus and creates
no replacement documentation. It reads the CURRENT REPOSITORY STATE ONLY and compiles it
into a deterministic execution program: a backlog, a dependency graph, waves, a critical
path, parallel groups, validation and certification gates, and a readiness determination
an autonomous implementation agent can execute without further architectural analysis.

Authoritative in-repo inputs (state of record, read-only)
    00-MASTER/MCP-003-MASTER-EXECUTION.md          MEP-01..MEP-10 master execution program
    00-MASTER/MCP-002-MASTER-STATE.md              §02 blockers · §05 next authorized capability
    00-MASTER/UCDA-000001/ucda-decisions.json      18 registered implementation work packages
    intelligence/UCOS-RIE-AEOS-READINESS.json      G-01..G-12 execution-spine gaps + severity
    intelligence/UCOS-RIE-EXECUTION-FRONTIER.json  declared frontier + critical path
    intelligence/UCOS-RIE-DEPENDENCY-GRAPH.json    declared layered architecture (bottom-up)
    00-MASTER/UAKOS-CLOSURE-002/closure.json       440 concepts: disposition/in_code/certified
    00-MASTER/UAKOS-CLOSURE-008/assimilation.json  homed knowledge items + waves + destinations
    HEAD file evidence                             band realization probes (completion reports,
                                                   freeze modules) — the only measurement taken

Outputs (regenerated deterministically, no timestamps)
    roadmap.json                                   the machine-readable execution program
    01..10-*.md                                    the ten mandated roadmap artifacts

Usage
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-MXR-001/roadmap_engine.py
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-MXR-001/roadmap_engine.py --gate     # exit 1 unless executable
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-MXR-001/roadmap_engine.py --render   # re-render 01..10 from
                                                               # roadmap.json (replay)

`--render` replays the COMMITTED roadmap.json instead of recompiling it, so the HEAD recorded
in the artifacts is the HEAD they were compiled at. A committed artifact can never contain the
sha of the commit that carries it, so a drift gate MUST replay rather than recompile; the
recompile path (`--gate`) proves the program is still derivable from the registers.

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH). This engine authorizes nothing, ratifies nothing and
certifies nothing. It orders work that the repository's own registers already own.
