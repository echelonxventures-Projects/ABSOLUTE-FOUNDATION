"""UCOS Omega-Infinity — UCOS-RFP-001 Repository Fixed-Point Closure engine.

Executable expression of ``rfp-declaration.json``. The declaration is the ONLY
place the principle, the vocabulary, the artifact classes, the cycle classes, the
pipeline and the closure criteria are stated; this module holds no artifact path,
no lane name, no producer name and no programme field name as a literal. Adding a
producer, a cycle class, an artifact class or a criterion is an edit to that DATA
file and never to this file (PR-07 Zero Enumeration, mechanically proven by
``--check-no-enumeration``).

    rfp_engine.py                        regenerate this programme's determinations
    rfp_engine.py --gate                 G-15: prove the repository is a fixed point
    rfp_engine.py --detect               classify self-reference topologies, per stage
    rfp_engine.py --check-declaration    declaration integrity
    rfp_engine.py --check-no-enumeration zero-enumeration proof
    rfp_engine.py --check-write-scope    forbidden-write guard
    rfp_engine.py --check-determinism    self-determinism (byte-identical rendering)
    rfp_engine.py --check-self-compliance this engine obeys RFP-2 and RFP-3 itself
    rfp_engine.py --check-producer-completeness  discover every producer, prove each declared

Exit semantics:
    0  the asserted property holds
    1  the asserted property does not hold (gate CLOSED)
    2  fail-closed abort — the declaration or a required substrate is unusable, so
       no verdict may be asserted

SELF-APPLICATION. This engine is bound by the principle it enforces. Its emitted
artifacts therefore record the declaration and nothing measured: no commit
identity (RFP-2) and no observation of the working tree (RFP-3) — including its
own verdict, which is carried by the exit code and standard output alone. An
engine that wrote "repository is a fixed point" into the repository would falsify
that sentence by writing it. This is the defect class the programme exists to
abolish, so the programme may not commit it.

Standard library only.

# RFP-6 obliges every producer of tracked content to be a declared stage, but

# producer omitted from the pipeline never runs, so omission — the very defect the
# rule exists to forbid — was the one thing the rule could not see.
#
# The repair is to stop trusting the pipeline as the list of producers and to
# DISCOVER producers from the repository instead. Discovery uses two authorities,
# both declared, neither of which is a list of producers:
#
#   the Execution Surface     what the repository says it executes — recipe lines
#                             and CI steps. It cannot go stale without the build
#                             breaking, which is what makes it a usable authority.
#   entry-point signatures    language-level structure (a module's __main__ guard,
#                             a file's shebang). Not a naming convention: a
#                             role-suffixed filename is never consulted, so files
#                             that do not exist yet are classified correctly.

# what it wrote. Nothing infers a producer from where it lives or what it is
# called, so no naming convention, allowlist or denylist appears here or in data.
