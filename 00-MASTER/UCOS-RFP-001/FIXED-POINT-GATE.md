# UCOS-RFP-001 — REPOSITORY FIXED-POINT GATE (G-15)

> This projection records the DECLARATION only. It carries no commit identity

## What the gate does

It executes the declared pipeline **3 times** over the committed HEAD and requires the repository to be byte-identical after every pass. Stability is an observation over repetitions: a fixed point seen once may be coincidence.

## Mandatory closure criteria

| ID | Criterion | Measure | Expect | Blocking |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CLO-01 | the tree is clean before the fixed point is asserted | `initial_dirty_entries` | 0 | yes |
| CLO-02 | every required pipeline stage exits successfully | `stage_failures` | 0 | yes |
| CLO-03 | no tracked file is modified by any pass | `tracked_modifications` | 0 | yes |
| CLO-04 | no file is staged by any pass | `staged_entries` | 0 | yes |
| CLO-05 | no untracked entry appears outside a constitutionally excluded location | `untracked_outside_excluded` | 0 | yes |
| CLO-06 | the repository is byte-identical after every declared pass | `non_fixed_point_passes` | 0 | yes |
| CLO-07 | no self-reference cycle is detected | `cycles_detected` | 0 | yes |
| CLO-08 | all residue is attributable to a declared producer | `unattributed_paths` | 0 | yes |
| CLO-09 | every discovered producer is a declared pipeline stage | `undeclared_producers` | 0 | yes |
| CLO-10 | every path a producer writes lies inside a declared write zone | `producer_writes_outside_zones` | 0 | yes |
| CLO-11 | declared write zones are pairwise disjoint, so ownership is exactly one | `overlapping_write_zones` | 0 | yes |
| CLO-12 | no discovered producer candidate is left unprobed | `unprobed_producer_candidates` | 0 | yes |
| CLO-13 | no stage writes into another stage's declared write zone | `cross_zone_writes` | 0 | yes |

## Exit semantics

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | the repository is a Repository Fixed Point — gate OPEN |
| 1 | the repository is not a fixed point — gate CLOSED |
| 2 | fail-closed abort — declaration unusable, no verdict asserted |

## Why the gate records nothing

The verdict is an observation of the working tree. Persisting it would violate RFP-3 and make the record permanently false (Evidence Drift). The gate therefore reports through its exit code and standard output, and its generated artifacts carry the declaration alone.
