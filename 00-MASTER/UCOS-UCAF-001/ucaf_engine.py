"""UCOS-UCAF-001 — Universal Constitutional Authority Framework.

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH). This engine creates no authority, confers no authority,
occupies no tier, ratifies nothing and certifies no artifact. Every authority it registers is
DISCOVERED by reading a located instrument that already defines it; every competence question
it answers is answered by a clause it reads out of a located instrument; every conflict it
finds between a recorded claim of authority absence and located evidence of authority presence
is reported and referred to the claim owner, never decided here.

It also reads the tier PROJECTION every gate consults against the canonical lattice that
projection projects, and against the charter vesting that lattice may not amend; and it
discovers the authority tokens the executable plane mints, so an authority that is exercised by
code is bound to the authority the corpus located. Corroboration is computed only for a tier
already reported occupied: reading located evidence as the occupant of a recorded vacancy would
be a promotion, which this engine must never perform.

    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-UCAF-001/ucaf_engine.py --render     # regenerate the registers
    python3 00-MASTER/UCOS-UCAF-001/ucaf_engine.py --gate       # fail-closed authority gate

Exit semantics:
    0  every blocking validation satisfied — gate OPEN
    1  a blocking validation unsatisfied, or a self-guard failed — gate CLOSED
    2  fail-closed abort — the declaration is unusable, so no verdict may be asserted

Every source, tier pointer, lattice pointer, vesting pointer, realization source, token class,
realization binding, delegation pointer, succession pointer, scope rule, resolution question,
reconciliation, admission disposition and validation dimension is read from
ucaf-authority.json. No authority identifier, no tier identifier, no vacancy identifier, no
minted token and no resolution answer appears as a literal below, which is what makes extension
an edit to DATA and to the located instruments rather than to code.

Stdlib only. No network. No timestamp, no duration, no commit identity and no absolute path is
emitted, so the sealed output set is byte-identical for an unchanged repository.
