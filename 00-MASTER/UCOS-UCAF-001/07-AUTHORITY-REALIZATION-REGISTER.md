# UCOS-UCAF-001 · Authority Realization

An authority is declared by an instrument and EXERCISED by code. Every token below
is DISCOVERED from the executable plane; none is declared by this programme. Two
properties are measured independently, and the second cannot waive the first.

1. **No collision.** No token minted in the executable plane may be a registered
   constitutional authority. This is the machine form of the prohibition on
   governance asserting, simulating or substituting for constitutional authority.
2. **Classified.** Every discovered token must belong to a declared class recording
   what it is and why it is not a constitutional authority. An undisclosed token
   closes the gate whatever it says.

## Declared token classes

| Class | Token | Class | Constitutional | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `UCAF-TC-01` | `ENGINEERING-EXECUTION-ONLY` | ENGINEERING-EXECUTION | no | 00-CEP/CEP-003-CONSTITUTIONAL-EXECUTION-CONSTITUTION.md ARTICLE I.3 — execution authority SHALL NOT govern, ratify, decide constitutional content, or exercise a power reserved to a higher tier. A module minting this token discloses that it acts and holds nothing. |
| `UCAF-TC-02` | `NONE (DERIVED TRUTH)` | DERIVED-TRUTH | no | 00-CMG/CMG-000001 ARTICLE XVI.2 — the derived-truth tier records and asserts nothing. A module minting this token discloses that it computes and refuses rather than legislating. |
| `UCAF-TC-03` | `authority` | DELTA-REGISTER-KEY | no | engine/uckp/state.py — one of the five delta registers a UCKP transition is required to carry. The constant is a register key in a state record, not a claim to hold authority; it is disclosed here rather than filtered in code so that the discovered population is never quietly narrowed. |
| `UCAF-TC-04` | `Universal Foundation Constitutional Authority` | IMPLEMENTATION-CONFORMANCE | no | platform/universal_foundation/constitution.py — the declared owner of UCOS-UFC-001, the law governing whether a Foundation CAPABILITY conforms across the thirteen domains it names (contracts, services, providers, policies, registries, runtimes, lifecycle, compatibility, evolution, governance, certification, composition, specialization). Its subject is implementation conformance, never constitutional content: it cannot ratify, cannot legislate, cannot vest or revoke a tier, and cannot override a located canonical owner. Its standing is AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH) under 00-CMG/CMG-000001 ARTICLE XVI.2 — it measures and refuses. Disclosed here rather than filtered in code so the discovered population is never quietly narrowed. |
| `UCAF-TC-05` | `FG-15-NO-PARALLEL-AUTHORITY` | CONSTITUTIONAL-GATE-IDENTITY | no | platform/universal_foundation/convergence.py — the identity of the executable gate that proves UCOS-UFC-001 UFC-15, the article FORBIDDING a parallel constitutional authority. The symbol name ends in AUTHORITY because the article it proves is about authority; the constant is the name of a measurement, not a claim to hold anything. Classified for the same reason as UCAF-TC-03: the discovered population is disclosed in full and narrowed by declaration, never by a filter in code. |
| `UCAF-TC-06` | `accountable_authority` | RESOLUTION-LEDGER-FIELD | no | engine/uckp/intelligence.py — the field name under which an entry of the constitutional `category_ownership_resolution` declares the party accountable for a category's population, read by the declared-versus-measured category integrity join (PHASE-UCF-013). The constant is a JSON key in a resolution record, not a claim to hold authority. What the key names is held distinct from constitutional authority in three separate ways, each already determined: the value is a governance entity accountable for a category's population POLICY, severed by PHASE-UCF-012 D4 from the Ownership.owner value space (Facet 7) precisely so it cannot be aggregated into one; what a category IS remains GOVERNED_CATEGORIES under Article 17, which the ledger cites and never re-declares (PHASE-UCF-012 § 8.2, 'there is no vacancy here'); and the reasoner that reads the key reports at OBSERVATION severity and can move no certification verdict. The resolution sections it belongs to are recognitive, never constitutive — each records a standing that measurement already shows to hold and grants no right (PHASE-UCF-012 § 6.3). Disclosed here rather than renamed in code, for the same reason as UCAF-TC-03 and UCAF-TC-05: the discovered population is narrowed by declaration, never by a filter — and a symbol chosen to fall outside the discovery pattern would be that filter under another name. |
| `UCAF-TC-07` | `AUTHORITY` | PROJECTION-ROLE-NAME | no | engine/root_ontology/model.py — the name of one of the four ROLES a site may hold in UCPA-000001's classification of artifacts that state the root ontology (AUTHORITY, RATIFICATION_RECORD, PROJECTION, SUPERSEDED). The constant is a role LABEL compared against declared data, not a claim to hold authority: the programme's own standing is AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH), it legislates no ontology, and UCPA-L-06 requires the single site bearing this role to be the canonical owner that 00-MASTER/URRC-000001/urrc-bindings.json D-24 already binds — so the label can only ever point at an owner determined elsewhere, and can never vest one. Disclosed here rather than renamed in code for the reason UCAF-TC-06 records: a symbol chosen to fall outside the discovery pattern would be a filter under another name, and the discovered population must be narrowed by declaration only. |
