"""UCOS-UGA-001 — Universal Governance Assimilation Engine.

Brings every version-controlled object that is NOT a corpus document under the
SAME constitutional control the corpus already has: identity, ownership,
lifecycle, dependency closure, evidence boundary, audit history, validation.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`00-BOOK/tools/config.py::INCLUDE_EXTENSIONS` is (.md, .txt, .docx, .json). The
registration boundary is document-only, so at the time of authoring 1936
version-controlled executable and configuration objects — including all 29
producers named by the generated-artifact registry — had no universal identity,
no owner and no lifecycle. The corpus governed its artifacts by naming engines
that were themselves anonymous.

The identity authority, audit universe, evidence universe and relationship graph
already existed and already worked. What was missing was a TERM for a thing that
executes rather than a thing that is read. This engine adds the object class, not
a parallel government.

ONE IDENTITY AUTHORITY
----------------------
Identities are minted from `00-BOOK/DATA/id-ledger.json` using the SAME
`category_seq` counter as the corpus, into an append-only `by_object` map. This
is the construction EXEC-REG-001 already established for `by_execution`. No page
range is consumed: pages are a BOOK concept, so `page_cursor` is never touched
and the corpus page layout is bit-for-bit unaffected. `ukb.py cmd_build` iterates
the document eligibility universe (never the ledger), and `load_ledger` preserves
unknown keys, so `by_object` is invisible to the corpus transaction by
construction rather than by convention.

DETERMINISM
-----------
No output contains a wall clock. Every timestamp emitted is a `first_seen` frozen
in the append-only ledger at mint time. A second run with no repository change is
a no-op on disk, which is what makes Phase-8 fixed point and Phase-9 pristine
clone checkable by plain byte comparison.

USAGE
    uga_engine.py gate    verify invariants; mutate nothing; exit 1 on violation
    uga_engine.py stats   print the current measured state
    uga_engine.py run     GOVERNED / IRREVERSIBLE. Allocates permanent identity into the
                          append-only 00-BOOK/DATA/id-ledger.json. This is a
                          CORPUS_REGISTRATION-class mutation reserved for REG-AUTO-001
                          authorization (00-BOOK/DATA/mutation-governance-boundary.json).
                          It is NOT an operator remediation: diagnose with `gate`, obtain
                          authorization, and let the authorized transaction allocate.

# UNIVERSAL OBSERVATION LINEAGE BOUNDARY — UCOS-OBSERVATION-UNIVERSE-001
#
# "Observation influence must never enter canonical identity, directly or through
# derived values."
#
# The three guards that existed before this — OBS-INV-02 (declared keys), OBS-INV-07
# (signature sweep) and RIB's own strip (_WORKING_TREE_MEASURES) — are the SAME KIND of
# instrument: a vocabulary of leak NAMES. None of the six values that broke Phase 8 is
# spelled like a leak; `gates_passed` is a perfectly innocent name for a contaminated
# number. A name-based test can only find the leaks someone already thought of.
#
# So the boundary is measured two ways, neither of them lexical, and neither of them a
# new pipeline:
#
#   OBS-INV-11  DIFFERENTIAL. Hold the commit fixed, vary a declared observation source,
#               require the canonical projection to be byte-identical. It must EXECUTE a
#               producer's projection function, which this engine may not do — it is
#               stdlib-only so the constitutional gate workflows can run it, and running
#               producers from here would make it a second execution engine. It is
#               measured in the pytest stage of verify.sh, the same single pipeline.
#   OBS-INV-12  Every producer holding canonical output declares the observation sources
#               it actually reads. Measured HERE, by reading the producer's source with
#               docstrings and comments removed — because three producers carry the words
#               `coverage.xml` in prose describing a leak UCOS-CL-005 already closed, and
#               a guard that cannot tell prose from a call site cries wolf.
#   OBS-INV-13  Every canonical artifact proves its ancestry: the transitive closure of
#               its input_closure, with every ancestor classified.

# CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY ALIGNMENT — UCOS-CAA-001
#
# Seven instruments in this repository declared themselves "AUTHORED REPOSITORY TRUTH
# … upstream of every engine that reads it", and not one named the authority it was
# upstream UNDER. Each was right about what it authored; together they were seven roots,
# and UCKP-ART-01 admits one. The same absence made the two duplications visible but
# unmeasurable: the id-ledger and UCKP identity both mint, and this programme emits a
# relationship graph while engine/uckp/graph.py declares what a relationship IS. Neither
# was a rival implementation. Both were UNDECLARED SUBORDINATIONS, which is what a rival
# looks like to anything that has to check.
#
# WHY THE MEASUREMENT LIVES HERE. This engine is the repository reality projection, and
# every one of these is a measurement of repository reality. Measuring them here means
# the gate `verify.sh` ALREADY runs (Stage 6b) enforces them: no new stage, no second
# pipeline, no second criteria set. A separate gate for the invariants that forbid a
# second authority would be a joke told with a straight face.
#
# WHY IT IS STDLIB-ONLY. This module may not import engine.uckp — the constitutional gate
# workflows run it with a bare interpreter. So the law is not imported; it is READ, from
# its one home, and the derivation contract is read from the binding, which
# engine.uckp.alignment.verify_binding resolves against its own constants. Two readers,
# one truth, and a test between them rather than two copies that can drift.
