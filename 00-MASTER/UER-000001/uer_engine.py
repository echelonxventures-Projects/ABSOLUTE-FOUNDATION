"""UER-000001 — Universal Execution Resilience engine (UCOS Ω∞ Programme Ω∞-001A).

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH). This engine legislates nothing, ratifies nothing,
freezes no architecture and owns no capability. It is the executable expression of
the Execution Resilience contract: it reads a single DATA declaration
(``uer-resilience.json``) that binds each mandated resilience capability to the
repository home that already realises it, verifies that every declared home and
evidence reference resolves against Repository Truth, and computes — never asserts —
the coverage, validation, certification and readiness verdicts.

    python3 00-MASTER/UER-000001/uer_engine.py                  # regenerate + report
    python3 00-MASTER/UER-000001/uer_engine.py --gate            # fail-closed
    python3 00-MASTER/UER-000001/uer_engine.py --check-declaration
    python3 00-MASTER/UER-000001/uer_engine.py --check-no-enumeration
    python3 00-MASTER/UER-000001/uer_engine.py --check-write-scope
    python3 00-MASTER/UER-000001/uer_engine.py --check-determinism

Exit semantics of --gate:
    0  the gate is OPEN — every mandated capability is covered by a resolving home,
       every pipeline step is bound to a covered capability, and every mandatory
       validation and exit criterion is satisfied
    1  the gate is CLOSED — a capability, pipeline step, validation or exit criterion
       is not satisfied
    2  fail-closed abort — the declaration is unusable, so no verdict may be asserted

The engine contains no capability identifier, no mandate, no validation dimension and
no pipeline step as a literal: the resilience contract is DATA. A self-check proves
this. Extending the contract — binding a newly proven gap, or a new capability — is an
edit to the declaration and needs no code change.

Stdlib only. No network. No timestamp is emitted anywhere, so the sealed output set is
byte-identical for an unchanged repository state (the same determinism guarantee the
programme certifies for the platform it binds).
