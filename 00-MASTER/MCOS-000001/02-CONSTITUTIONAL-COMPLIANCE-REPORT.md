- Artifact: **MCOS-000001**
- Authority: **NONE (DERIVED TRUTH)**
- Layer home: `engine/civilization` (v1.0.0)
- Realizes over: engine/kernel (PROGRAM-002, immutable baseline)
- Verdict: **CONSTITUTIONALLY-COMPLIANT**

## Architectural quality gates

| Gate | Result | Criterion (declaration) | Evidence (executed) |
|---|---|---|---|
| no-closed-dimension-set | PASS | An arbitrary, never-seen dimension is admitted; the open set grows by exactly one. | admitted 'Axis-c11866a9' by registration; dimensions 0 -> 1 |
| no-finite-enumeration | PASS | No enum.Enum/IntEnum/StrEnum/Flag subclass exists anywhere in the layer. | no Enum/IntEnum/StrEnum/Flag class in the layer |
| no-hardcoded-dimension-assumptions | PASS | No prohibited token (language, currency, country, calendar, cloud, reality, ...) is built into the shipped vocabulary. | 21 prohibited tokens; vocabulary intersection [] |
| prohibited-tokens-representable-by-registration | PASS | Every prohibited token is nonetheless admitted as a registered dimension, so absence is neutrality and not incapacity. | all 21 tokens admitted by registration; missing [] |
| no-dimension-declares-a-ceiling | PASS | A dimension declaring a closed value set or a finite upper bound is refused at admission. | 5/5 ceiling declarations refused at admission |
| no-fixed-pipeline | PASS | Registering a capability changes the derived plan with no code change, and the derivation rule is itself a registered, replaceable strategy. | registering a capability changed the plan (2 -> 3 steps) with no code change; 2 strategies registered; the same declarations yield different plans per strategy |
| no-finite-operating-system-catalogue | PASS | A never-seen constitutional operating system is registered, generated end to end, and its lineage verified. | generated 'OS-cfe22538'; catalogue 0 -> 1; lineage rooted at the kernel |
| no-finite-generation-chain | PASS | A never-seen generation stratum extends the chain by registration alone. | generation depth 9 -> 10 by registration alone |
| nothing-bypasses-the-meta-kernel | PASS | Every generated record and every composed step is admitted through the kernel registry and roots at the kernel reflective root. | 9 generated records and 1 composed step(s), every one admitted through the kernel registry and rooted at UMK-METATYPE-4d7c15ebcab0 |
| no-parallel-constitutional-authority | PASS | The layer declares authority NONE and all three components admit through one kernel registry. | declared authority 'NONE'; all three components admit through the single kernel registry, so no parallel authority and no second registry exist |
| no-implementation-leakage | PASS | Two independently constructed platforms produce an identical snapshot hash. | independent platform snapshot hashes match: 8b1b1e59a09c38e4… |
| unknown-future-compatibility | PASS | The mandatory architectural proof passes and neither the layer nor the kernel source changed. | 12/12 categories and 5/5 operating systems admitted by registration; layer unchanged=True, kernel unchanged=True |

**Overall: CONSTITUTIONALLY-COMPLIANT** (passed=True).

## Mandate prohibitions

| Prohibition | How it is enforced | Result |
|---|---|---|
| DO NOT duplicate concepts | `--check-reuse-before-create`: a REUSED responsibility homed inside this layer fails closed | PASS |
| DO NOT introduce competing architectures | gate `no-parallel-constitutional-authority`: one kernel registry across all three components | PASS |
| DO NOT create parallel constitutional authorities | `MetaCivilizationPlatform.authority == 'NONE'`, asserted by the same gate | PASS |
| No hardcoding, no finite assumptions | gates `no-finite-enumeration`, `no-hardcoded-dimension-assumptions`, `no-dimension-declares-a-ceiling`, `no-finite-operating-system-catalogue`, `no-finite-generation-chain` | PASS |
| Nothing shall bypass the Meta Kernel | gate `nothing-bypasses-the-meta-kernel`: every record roots at the reflective root | PASS |
