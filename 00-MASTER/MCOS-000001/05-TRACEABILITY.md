## Responsibility → Home → Disposition

| ID | Responsibility | Home | Disposition | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MCOS-R-01 | Universal Meta Kernel — highest constitutional authority | `engine/kernel/kernel.py` | REUSED | PROGRAM-002. Not re-implemented. This layer registers into it and never edits it. |
| MCOS-R-02 | Meta Laws and Meta Principles bound at admission | `engine/kernel/governance.py` | REUSED | The layer's invariants are registered Constraints in the kernel's open admission policy. |
| MCOS-R-03 | Meta Ontology — the single universal thing | `engine/kernel/meta.py` | REUSED | MetaObject and the self-classifying MetaType root; no second ontology is defined. |
| MCOS-R-04 | Meta Taxonomy — open classification by registration | `engine/civilization/metatypes.py` | EXTENDED | The layer's vocabulary is DATA seeded as kernel meta-types; no closed enumeration. |
| MCOS-R-05 | Meta Registry Model — one admission authority | `engine/kernel/registry.py` | REUSED | A second registry is prohibited (DEC-CAEM-07). Gate QG-10 proves there is one. |
| MCOS-R-06 | Meta Capability Model — declared, discoverable, composable | `engine/civilization/composition.py` | NEW | Discharges DEC-ADAM-14 / WP-UCDA-006 declarative composition. |
| MCOS-R-07 | Meta Governance Model — nothing is admitted ungoverned | `engine/kernel/governance.py` | REUSED | Governance decides; the registry mutates. This layer adds constraints, not authority. |
| MCOS-R-08 | Meta Runtime Model — execution composed, not scripted | `engine/civilization/composition.py` | NEW | A plan is derived from declarations, context, policy and evidence at request time. |
| MCOS-R-09 | Meta Engineering Model — the Universal Engineering Platform surface | `engine/civilization/mcos.py` | EXTENDED | Names the CONCEPTUAL/UNNAMED Meta-Platform of PLATFORM-005/010 as a realization layer. |
| MCOS-R-10 | Meta Evolution Model — unlimited constitutional evolution | `engine/civilization/generation.py` | EXTENDED | Strata, operating systems and dimensions all extend by registration. CEP-009 governs. |
| MCOS-R-11 | MCOS generates unlimited constitutional operating systems | `engine/civilization/generation.py` | NEW | An operating system is a registered meta-type, so the catalogue is never finite. |
| MCOS-R-12 | Universal Dimension Model — every dimension registerable | `engine/civilization/dimensions.py` | NEW | Complements engine/context (frames/values/laws); owns which axes exist at all. |
| MCOS-R-13 | Every dimension discoverable | `engine/civilization/dimensions.py` | NEW | DimensionRegistry.discover over context, policy and specialization. |
| MCOS-R-14 | Every dimension governed | `engine/civilization/dimensions.py` | EXTENDED | Two Constraints bound into the kernel: facets complete, and no declared ceiling. |
| MCOS-R-15 | Every dimension composable and extensible without limit | `engine/civilization/dimensions.py` | NEW | COMPOSES has no arity limit; SPECIALIZES has no depth limit. |
| MCOS-R-16 | Every dimension context aware and policy aware | `engine/civilization/dimensions.py` | NEW | Declared contexts and policies bind to a dimension without altering it. |
| MCOS-R-17 | Every dimension implementation independent | `engine/civilization/compliance.py` | NEW | 21 prohibited tokens are absent from the vocabulary yet all representable. |
| MCOS-R-18 | Universal Capability Discovery | `engine/discovery/dimensions.py` | REUSED | Present-canonical, registry-driven, zero hard-coded patterns. Referenced only. |
| MCOS-R-19 | Constitutional Generation Model — the ordered stratum chain | `engine/civilization/generation.py` | NEW | Nine ratified strata as DATA; a tenth is a registration, not an edit. |
| MCOS-R-20 | Nothing bypasses the Meta Kernel | `engine/civilization/generation.py` | NEW | Every generated record carries one derivation edge; the lineage roots at the kernel. |
| MCOS-R-21 | Universal Open-World Expansion — no intrinsic limit | `engine/civilization/compliance.py` | EXTENDED | The executed mechanism behind the two existing unboundedness certifications. |
| MCOS-R-22 | Universal identity for everything registered | `engine/kernel/identity.py` | REUSED | Deterministic, version-independent kernel identity. No second identity scheme. |
| MCOS-R-23 | Knowledge Once across every generated artefact | `engine/kernel/governance.py` | REUSED | The content-unique constraint makes generation idempotent by construction. |
| MCOS-R-24 | Complete traceability of every registration | `engine/kernel/registry.py` | REUSED | Hash-chained append-only journal; trace() resolves any identity. |
| MCOS-R-25 | No parallel constitutional authority | `engine/civilization/mcos.py` | NEW | authority == 'NONE' and one shared kernel, both proven by blocking gate QG-10. |
| MCOS-R-26 | Deterministic, reproducible platform state | `engine/civilization/seeding.py` | NEW | Order-independent seeding; two independent platforms are byte-identical. |

## Quality gate → executed evidence

| Gate | Evidence |
|---|---|
| no-closed-dimension-set | admitted 'Axis-c11866a9' by registration; dimensions 0 -> 1 |
| no-finite-enumeration | no Enum/IntEnum/StrEnum/Flag class in the layer |
| no-hardcoded-dimension-assumptions | 21 prohibited tokens; vocabulary intersection [] |
| prohibited-tokens-representable-by-registration | all 21 tokens admitted by registration; missing [] |
| no-dimension-declares-a-ceiling | 5/5 ceiling declarations refused at admission |
| no-fixed-pipeline | registering a capability changed the plan (2 -> 3 steps) with no code change; 2 strategies registered; the same declarations yield different plans per strategy |
| no-finite-operating-system-catalogue | generated 'OS-cfe22538'; catalogue 0 -> 1; lineage rooted at the kernel |
| no-finite-generation-chain | generation depth 9 -> 10 by registration alone |
| nothing-bypasses-the-meta-kernel | 9 generated records and 1 composed step(s), every one admitted through the kernel registry and rooted at UMK-METATYPE-4d7c15ebcab0 |
| no-parallel-constitutional-authority | declared authority 'NONE'; all three components admit through the single kernel registry, so no parallel authority and no second registry exist |
| no-implementation-leakage | independent platform snapshot hashes match: 8b1b1e59a09c38e4… |
| unknown-future-compatibility | 12/12 categories and 5/5 operating systems admitted by registration; layer unchanged=True, kernel unchanged=True |
