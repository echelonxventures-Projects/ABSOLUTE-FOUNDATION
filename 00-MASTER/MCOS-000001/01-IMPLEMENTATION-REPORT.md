# Universal Meta-Civilization Platform — PROGRAM-004 (WAVE-2)

- Artifact: **MCOS-000001**
- Authority: **NONE (DERIVED TRUTH)**
- Layer home: `engine/civilization` (v1.0.0)
- Realizes over: engine/kernel (PROGRAM-002, immutable baseline)
- Verdict: **CONSTITUTIONALLY-COMPLIANT**
- Report hash: `fed5b1851302af19d1cca195efc774324135dc3ca91fd375bd9433bef16edc10`

## What was implemented

The Universal Meta-Civilization Platform: the layer that **generates constitutional operating systems**. It stands to the Universal Meta-Kernel exactly as the Universal Provider Framework does — a realization layer holding no authority of its own. Three components over **one** kernel: an open dimension space (the Universal Dimension Model), a planner that derives execution from declarations rather than a pipeline (Dynamic Capability Composition), and an ordered chain of registered strata through which a constitutional operating system comes into being (the Constitutional Generation Model).

## Reuse analysis (duplicate detection)

Reuse-First was applied to all ten mandated constructs before a single file was authored, and seven of the ten resolved onto an existing canonical owner and were NOT re-implemented. (1) Universal Meta Kernel ALREADY EXISTS at engine/kernel v1.0.0 under UMK-000001 / PROGRAM-002 with ADR-0003 Accepted; this layer registers INTO it and defines no meta-model, identity minting, governance engine, audit journal or registry of its own. (2) Universal Registry Architecture ALREADY EXISTS: the kernel's UniversalRegistry is the single admission authority and DEC-CAEM-07 prohibits a second registry; the no-parallel-constitutional-authority gate proves all three components of this layer admit through one kernel. (3) Universal Capability Discovery ALREADY EXISTS at engine/discovery (8 registry-driven dimensions, zero hard-coded patterns) and is referenced, not duplicated. (4) The Universal Open-World Expansion Model is ALREADY CERTIFIED at 03-CONSTITUTIONAL-UNBOUNDEDNESS-CERTIFICATION.md (16 axes) and 04-HIDDEN-FINITE-ASSUMPTION-CERTIFICATION.md (23 axes); this layer supplies the executed mechanism those determinations describe rather than a second determination. (5) Unlimited Constitutional Evolution is ALREADY OWNED by 00-CEP/CEP-009 and UEI-000001. (6) The Universal Engineering Platform is the CONCEPTUAL/UNNAMED Meta-Platform of 02-CANONICAL-OWNERSHIP-MATRIX.md, owned in substance by 09-PLATFORM/PLATFORM-005 and PLATFORM-010 and 07-ENGINEERING; UCOS-NUCLEUS-001/02 section 6 forbids making it a new nucleus, so it is EXTENDED and named, never authored. (7) 'MCOS' is dispositioned RESOLVE-NAME onto MCS-000 by DEC-CAEM-13, and DEC-CAEM-13R REJECTS vesting authority in it; accordingly MetaCivilizationPlatform.authority is the literal string 'NONE' and a blocking quality gate fails if that ever changes. Only three constructs were genuinely absent as executable mechanism and are supplied here: the Universal Dimension Model as an open, governed, registrable dimension SPACE (engine/context/** owns context frames, values and the twelve CXL laws — what a situation IS; this layer owns which axes exist at all, and neither module imports the other); Dynamic Capability Composition, which 03-ARCHITECTURAL-DECISION-ASSIMILATION-MATRIX.md registers as DEC-ADAM-14 carried by work package WP-UCDA-006 and which engine/factory/orchestrator.py did not provide because its execute() was at that time a fixed six-step sequence (that sequence has since been removed and its order derived, discharging DEC-MCOS-14 / WP-UCDA-018); and the Constitutional Generation Model at the operating-system stratum, one layer ABOVE the six frozen 05-GENERATION families, which generate artefacts WITHIN a single operating system and are untouched here.

| 2 | `MetaCivilizationStratum` | Meta-Civilization Operating System |
| 3 | `BlueprintStratum` | Constitutional Blueprint |

The chain is DATA, not architecture: a tenth stratum is a registration (`register_stratum`), never an edit.
