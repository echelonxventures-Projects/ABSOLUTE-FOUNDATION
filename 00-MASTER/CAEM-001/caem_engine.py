"""CAEM-001 — mandate disposition engine.

MISSION
    Take every mandate the six governing documents state, locate what already OWNS it,
    and disposition it. Five outcomes; only one of them is new construction.

AUTHORITY
    NONE — DERIVED TRUTH. This engine ratifies nothing, certifies nothing, occupies no
    tier and writes ONLY inside 00-MASTER/CAEM-001/.

WHY IT EXISTS
    CAEM-001 §1 performed this act for THIRTEEN concepts, by hand, and said why it had
    to be by hand: `21-CONCEPT-NORMALIZATION-REGISTER.md` and `23-SEMANTIC-EQUIVALENCE-
    MATRIX.md` state that no semantic matching is performed "because doing so would
    fabricate equivalence; equivalence is decided only by canonical-ID identity."

    Six documents mandate 1,449. Thirteen by hand does not scale to 1,449, and semantic
    matching is forbidden. This engine takes the only remaining road: it measures what
    can be measured — does a name occur, in what kind of file, and does anything NAME
    this concept — and then refuses to convert that measurement into an equivalence
    claim. Every disposition it derives is marked PROVISIONAL. Promotion to CONFIRMED
    is a human act recorded in the disposition file, never something this engine does.

    THE ERROR THIS ENGINE IS SHAPED AROUND. The first disposition pass used "zero grep
    hits" as the test for a genuine gap and returned 376 of them. CAEM-001's founding
    measurement is the refutation: the token `Fabric` occurs in ZERO of 4,981 tracked
    files, yet six of the eight Fabrics have canonical homes under other names. Acting
    on 376 would have authored hundreds of rival authorities — void under UCKP-ART-03,
    and the precise failure this instrument exists to prevent. Re-asking each zero-hit
    label against its HEAD NOUN's owner collapsed 376 to 19.

USAGE
    python3 00-MASTER/CAEM-001/caem_engine.py --measure   # slow: ~5k greps, writes 07
    python3 00-MASTER/CAEM-001/caem_engine.py --render    # fast: 07 -> 08

    WHY THE FLAG EXISTS. Substring matching is safe for a phrase and catastrophic for a
    short word. Measured on this repository: `AR` matched 6,993 files and `AI` 5,069,
    because both occur inside *are*, *architecture*, *available* and *chain*; `ERP`
    matched 1,353 because Python is full of *interpreter*; `Board` matched 434 through
    *dashboard*; `Architect` matched 2,564 through *architecture*. Whole-word counts are
    226, 323, 31, 27 and 99 -- so between 94% and 98% of those hits were noise, and the
    200-file "too generic to decide" threshold was being applied to that noise.

    MORPHOLOGY IS KEPT. A bare whole-word match would swing the error the other way:
    `Recognize` would stop matching *recognized* (166 files down to 23) and `License`
    would stop matching *licensing* (49 down to 19). So a single word is matched as a
    STEM with an optional inflection -- boundary, word, optional s/es/d/ed/ing, boundary.
    Measured: ERP 1,353 -> 31, AR 6,993 -> 226, Board 434 -> 27, while License recovers
    to 40 and Recognize to 143. Noise removed, inflections retained.

    Phrases keep substring matching, which is already specific enough to be safe and
