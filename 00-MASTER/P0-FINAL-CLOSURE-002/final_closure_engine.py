"""P0-FINAL-CLOSURE-002 — Phase 8 fixed-point and Phase 9 pristine-clone measurement.

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH). This engine legislates nothing, registers nothing,
certifies nothing and owns no capability. It runs the located regeneration chain, measures
what changed, and records the result. It cannot make a state converge and cannot make a
clone agree; where either fails it emits the failure.

Phase 8 — the fixed point
-------------------------
A *round* is one execution of the located regeneration chain. Zero drift means the round
changed nothing: the repository regenerated itself and produced byte-identical output.
Eight variance dimensions are measured separately rather than as one digest, because
"something moved" is not an actionable finding — *which* identity moved is.

The measurement is only valid with **no concurrent writer**. The prior attempt at this
phase was contaminated by exactly that and correctly refused to derive a claim from it, so
this engine takes a working-tree fingerprint before and after every round and fails closed
if anything it did not run has written into the tree.

Phase 9 — the pristine clones
-----------------------------
Each clone is an independent ``git clone`` of the canonical repository at HEAD, verified on
its own and then compared against the canonical identities. A clone that regenerates to a
different digest means the output depends on something outside version control, which is
the defect this phase exists to detect.

    python3 00-MASTER/P0-FINAL-CLOSURE-002/final_closure_engine.py
    python3 00-MASTER/P0-FINAL-CLOSURE-002/final_closure_engine.py --rounds 5 --clones 3

    python3 00-MASTER/P0-FINAL-CLOSURE-002/final_closure_engine.py --gate

Exit semantics:
    0  both phases measured and every requirement met (or --gate not requested)
    1  --gate requested and a requirement was not met
    2  fail-closed abort — a concurrent writer, or a phase that could not be measured

No timestamp, no duration, no commit identity and no absolute path is emitted, so the
artifact set is byte-identical for an unchanged repository.

#: What Phase 9 compares between a clone and the canonical repository.
CLONE_IDENTITIES: Mapping[str, str] = dict(DIMENSIONS)

#: The bootstrap a pristine clone requires before the chain can run at all.
#:
#: Several substrates the chain declares REQUIRED are generated artifacts the repository
#: deliberately does not track (``/knowledge/`` and the ``UAKOS-CLOSURE-002`` outputs are
#: excluded by ``.gitignore`` under a stated generated-artifact policy). A clone therefore
#: does not contain them, and the chain fail-closed aborts rather than measuring a
#: repository it cannot see — correctly.
#:
#: Phase 9 requires each clone to be *bootstrapped independently*, and this is that
#: bootstrap: the located generators that produce the untracked substrates, run in the
#: clone, from the clone's own tracked content. Nothing is copied in from the canonical
#: repository — copying would make the clone a mirror rather than an independent
#: reproduction, and would prove nothing about reproducibility.
#: UCOS-RC-002 — the canonical toolchain is part of the bootstrap, not a precondition.
#:
#: DETERMINATION (Option A). UCOS-AEE-001 resolves its actuator interpreter as
#: ``REPO/.ec1-venv/bin/python`` (aee_engine.py::interpreters, the ``$PY`` slot).
#: ``.ec1-venv/`` is gitignored, so it is absent from every pristine clone, and this list
#: did not create it. The measured consequence at HEAD 382b65e8: all seventeen required
#: actuators returned ``executed=false, verdict=UNAVAILABLE, reason="the declared
#: interpreter is not present in this environment"``, which drove blocking_violations from
#: 0 to 17, violated CONV-02, and turned AEE's determination from CONVERGED-PROVISIONAL
#: into NOT-CONVERGED. That is the whole of Phase-9 certification_variance.
#:
#: Option A rather than "declare it an external prerequisite", because the repository has
#: already made that choice everywhere else: ``verify.sh`` states that a brand-new terminal
#: runs it with no manual activation and no tribal knowledge because it *self-heals* the
#: canonical venv, and ``.ec1-venv/`` is excluded on exactly the same ground as
#: ``/knowledge/`` and ``/realization/`` — deterministically re-derivable output, not
#: authored truth. An environment the repository can rebuild from its own declarations is
#: inside the reproducibility contract by construction; this list was simply incomplete.
#:
#: The provisioner is INVOKED, never reimplemented. ``ucos_ensure_venv`` in
#: scripts/ucos-env.sh is the single canonical definition — it pins the Python series and
#: the toolchain versions — so a second copy here would be exactly the drift this closure
#: has spent its effort removing. It runs first: every later bootstrap step and the whole
#: chain depend on the interpreter existing.

        ),

    #: UCOS-RC-004 — the prerequisite set is INVOKED, not restated.
    #:
    #: This tuple used to name five producers directly: closure, phase2, phase3, rie, and
    #: `knowledge capabilities --write`. That was a second, independent copy of a list the
    #: repository already owns. scripts/generate-prerequisites.sh declares itself "THE one
    #: definition of 're-derive the generated inputs the gates read'" and runs SEVEN steps,
    #: including the knowledge store's full three-step pipeline — `init --force`, then
    #: `capabilities --write`, then `docs` — plus determinism evidence. That script's own
    #: header records why all three knowledge steps are required: running `init` alone
    #: leaves the store at 11 CKOs of 121, "so every consumer measured a store truncated to
    #: 9% of itself".
    #:
    #: This copy ran ONLY `capabilities --write` — step two of three, without step one. So
    #: every clone carried a knowledge store that had never been seeded. Measured at
    #: 3af66dcc: UCDA's decision DEC-UKDA-DEC-0001 reported
    #: `evidence_unresolved: ['knowledge/decisions.json', 'knowledge/canonical-knowledge.json']`,
    #: dropping dimensions_covered from 278 to 272 and mutating all nine UCDA outputs. The
    #: same mechanism moved URRC, UPF, MCOS, UMK and UAKOS-CLOSURE-008 — 23 paths — which
    #: cycle-2 RIB then observed as a dirty tree, closing its gate (source OPEN, clone
    #: CLOSED) and carrying AEE with it. That is the whole of registry_variance,
