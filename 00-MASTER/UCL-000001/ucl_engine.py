"""UCL-000001 — Universal Constitutional Lifecycle.

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH). This engine legislates no lifecycle, opens no
registry, mints no identifier, declares no namespace, admits no capability and
certifies nothing. It DISCOVERS the constitutional stage graph the repository has
already legislated, normalizes it into Canonical Knowledge Objects, composes the
declared graph types, measures whether each stage is executable, and executes the
discovered graph as a deterministic traversal.

Everything it enforces is read from ``ucl-declaration.json``. This source file
contains no stage, no stage name, no stage ordering, no capability, no owner path,
no graph type, no relation type and no serialization parser choice: admitting a
stage, a capability, an object kind, a relation, a graph type, a provider, an
adapter, a serialization, an obligation, a property or an expansion axis is an
append-only edit to DATA and requires no change here (PR-07 Zero Enumeration).

Discovery pipeline (metadata in, Canonical Knowledge Objects out):

    Metadata Provider  — WHERE constitutional metadata lives, in which serialization
        ↓
    Metadata Adapter   — HOW those records normalize into CKOs of a declared kind
        ↓
    Canonical Knowledge Objects — kind, identity, owner, authority, provenance, relations
        ↓
    Discovery Engine   — composes graphs, evaluates obligations, orders, executes

The engine never sees a file, a format or a field name below the adapter layer, so
replacing a serialization or a storage technology changes no object kind, no
relation, no graph type, no obligation and no stage.

Implementation independence: only a provider whose discovery class MAY ORIGINATE
contributes objects. Implementation source is read as EVIDENCE only — to confirm a
symbol exists — and ``--check-implementation-independence`` fails closed if any
object or relation is ever traced to an evidence-class provider.

Determinism: the output is a pure function of tracked repository content. Nothing
here reads the wall clock, the commit identity (RFP-2) or the working tree's own
status (RFP-3), so the emitted bytes are stable and the repository remains a fixed
point. Execution resolves and records; it never re-invokes the stages' own engines,
which would create the self-observation topology RFP-3 forbids.

Exit semantics:
  0  gate OPEN / guard PASS
  1  gate CLOSED / guard FAIL
  2  fail-closed abort — the declaration is unusable, so no verdict may be asserted

    This is the mechanical proof that the lifecycle is graph-driven rather than

    The scan distinguishes EXECUTABLE BEHAVIOUR from documentation. Only string
    constants in executable position are examined — comments and docstrings are
    excluded by construction, because prose that names a stage changes nothing. The
    declaration's own field names are GOVERNED VOCABULARY and are likewise exempt:
    an engine must be able to name the fields of its declaration, and the vocabulary
    is derived from the declaration's keys rather than listed, so the exemption cannot
    be widened by hand. A discovered stage name, owner path, identifier or graph type
