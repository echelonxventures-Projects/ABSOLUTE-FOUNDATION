## Responsibility → Home

| ID | Responsibility | Home | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| UPF-R-01 | Universal Provider Contract | `engine/provider/framework.py` | Provider declares {name, version}; well-formedness enforced by governance. |
| UPF-R-02 | Universal Provider Identity | `engine/kernel/identity.py` | Deterministic kernel identity for every provider (reused). |

| UPF-R-04 | Universal Provider Classification | `engine/provider/metatypes.py` | Provider classified by an open provider-category meta-type. |
| UPF-R-05 | Universal Provider Discovery | `engine/provider/framework.py` | discover() by capability/category/context. |
| UPF-R-06 | Universal Provider Resolution | `engine/provider/framework.py` | resolve() to the single best compatible provider. |
| UPF-R-07 | Universal Provider Composition | `engine/provider/framework.py` | compose() via governed kernel relationships. |
| UPF-R-08 | Universal Provider Lifecycle | `engine/provider/framework.py` | transition() records open lifecycle states as kernel versions. |
| UPF-R-09 | Universal Provider Dependencies | `engine/provider/framework.py` | depends-on relationships; acyclic (kernel-enforced). |
| UPF-R-10 | Universal Provider Compatibility | `engine/provider/framework.py` | compatible() via semantic-version back-compatibility. |
| UPF-R-11 | Universal Provider Versioning | `engine/kernel/registry.py` | Provider version chains (reused kernel versioning). |
| UPF-R-12 | Universal Provider Selection | `engine/provider/selection.py` | Open selection-strategy registry; deterministic default. |
| UPF-R-13 | Universal Provider Negotiation | `engine/provider/framework.py` | negotiate() capability + contract + version requirements. |
| UPF-R-14 | Universal Provider Governance | `engine/provider/framework.py` | Provider constraints bound into the kernel's open governance. |
| UPF-R-15 | Universal Provider Validation | `engine/provider/framework.py` | validate() kernel + provider invariants. |
| UPF-R-16 | Universal Provider Certification | `engine/provider/framework.py` | certify() deterministic determination. |
| UPF-R-17 | Universal Provider Evidence | `engine/kernel/registry.py` | Tamper-evident kernel audit journal (reused). |
| UPF-R-18 | Universal Provider Metadata | `engine/provider/framework.py` | Open metadata attribute map per provider. |
| UPF-R-19 | Universal Provider Health Model | `engine/provider/framework.py` | health() over an open advertised health descriptor. |
| UPF-R-20 | Universal Provider Capability Advertisement | `engine/provider/framework.py` | capabilities advertised at registration; discoverable. |
| UPF-R-21 | Universal Provider Policy Binding | `engine/provider/framework.py` | bound-policy relationships. |
| UPF-R-22 | Universal Provider Context Binding | `engine/provider/framework.py` | bound-context relationships; discoverable by context. |
| UPF-R-23 | Universal Provider Audit Model | `engine/kernel/registry.py` | Every provider admission appended to the kernel audit chain (reused). |
| UPF-R-24 | Universal Provider Traceability | `engine/provider/framework.py` | trace() provider lineage via the kernel. |

## Quality gate → executed evidence

| Gate | Evidence |
|---|---|
| no-closed-provider-categories | admitted a never-seen provider category; the open set grew by one |
| no-finite-enumeration | no enum.Enum subclass exists in the provider framework package |
| no-vendor-technology-coupling | no vendor/technology token is baked into the framework mechanism |
| kernel-immutable | kernel source fingerprint unchanged after building the framework and registering eleven categories |
| open-world | an unknown provider category was registered, discovered and resolved |
| knowledge-once | the kernel's content-unique (Knowledge-Once) constraint is inherited |
| unknown-future-compatibility | 11/11 categories govern-registered; kernel_unchanged=True, framework_unchanged=True |
