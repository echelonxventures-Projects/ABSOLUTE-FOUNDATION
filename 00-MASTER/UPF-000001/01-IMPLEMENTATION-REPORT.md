# Universal Provider Framework — PROGRAM-003 (WAVE-2)

- Artifact: **UPF-000001**
- Authority: **NONE (DERIVED TRUTH)**
- Framework home: `engine/provider` (v1.0.0)
- Realizes over: engine/kernel (PROGRAM-002, immutable baseline)
- Verdict: **CONSTITUTIONALLY-COMPLIANT**
- Report hash: `ef1b44db496336df3905c1df7714900acf326115d989952c69b74e71b5eac773`

## What was implemented

The Universal Provider Framework: the constitutional realization layer over the immutable PROGRAM-002 kernel. A provider category is a registered kernel meta-type (open set); a provider is a kernel `MetaObject` classified by its category, carrying its contract, capabilities, metadata, health and lifecycle as open attributes and its dependencies / policy / context as governed relationships. The framework modifies neither the kernel nor any other package.

## Reuse analysis (duplicate detection)

A distinct EC-2 Universal Provider Architecture exists at platform/universal_provider (Terminal-04). It is a higher-layer artifact that does not reference the PROGRAM-002 kernel and contains a closed ProviderState enum. This framework is the ENGINE-layer realization over the immutable kernel; the engine layer cannot depend on the platform layer, so the two coexist at different layers over different substrates. engine/provider imports and modifies neither the kernel nor platform/universal_provider.

## Universal Provider Law honoured

- Possess identity, be registered, discoverable, governed, versioned, validated, certified, traceable, replaceable, composable, evolvable — each mechanised over the kernel. No provider requires framework redesign (registration only).
