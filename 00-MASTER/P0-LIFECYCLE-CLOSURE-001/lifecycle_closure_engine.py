"""P0-LIFECYCLE-CLOSURE-001 — Universal Constitutional Lifecycle Realization Engine.

AUTHORITY = NONE (DERIVED TRUTH). This engine legislates nothing, registers nothing,
certifies nothing and owns no capability. It does not decide what the lifecycle *is* —
``UCL-000001`` owns that — and it does not decide whether a stage is realized. It
*measures*, and every verdict it emits is a function of an observation it made by
executing something.

The rule it is built to obey
---------------------------
A declaration is not evidence. ``ucl-stage-manifest.json`` declares an owner, an
authority and an evidence set for all 45 stages; this engine treats every one of those
as a **claim to be tested**, never as a finding. A stage is IMPLEMENTED here only when
five independent measurements agree, and each of the five is an executed probe:

    1. the declared owner artifact resolves on disk                (ownership)
    2. the declared evidence includes a module that compiles       (executable engine)
    3. some registered provider discharges the stage and returns
       evidence that is not merely the stage's own declaration     (executable behaviour)
    4. re-running that discharge reproduces the same digest        (deterministic replay)
    5. a test references the evidence artifact, and coverage
       measures at least one of its statements executed            (test coverage)

Anything less is PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED, DECLARED_ONLY or MISSING, and the artifact
records *which* of the five failed. Nothing is inferred; a probe that cannot be run is
recorded as a failed probe, never as an absent one.

Why self-certification is structurally impossible here
------------------------------------------------------
Probe 3 refuses evidence a stage produced about itself. A provider that returns the
stage's own declaration identity as its evidence is recorded as **not** having
discharged the stage, which is what stops the manifest from proving the manifest.

    python3 00-MASTER/P0-LIFECYCLE-CLOSURE-001/lifecycle_closure_engine.py --gate

Exit semantics:
    0  every phase produced a determination and the closure gate was not requested,
       or it was requested and every claim measured PROVEN
    1  --gate was requested and at least one closure claim measured NOT_PROVEN
    2  fail-closed abort — a phase could not be measured, so no verdict may be asserted

No timestamp, no duration, no commit identity and no absolute path is emitted, so the
output set is byte-identical for an unchanged repository.
